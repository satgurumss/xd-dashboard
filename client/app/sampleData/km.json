What are the results?  Clinics are being set up so that patients can be treated for dehydration without  having to go to the hospital which may be too far for those in rural areas  Results not clear yet as data has not been extracted yet o Is it true that there are Ebola medicine and vaccines existed on the shelf but have gone untested for safety with humans?   There are likely pharmaceutical companies sitting on drug prototypes that are not moving quickly enough based on a lack of economic incentive from these poor countries   Testing has been accelerated with recent developments o Obama’s $6 billion request to fight Ebola  Right now there is a lack of facilities to treat the ill and that makes this an important decision for Congress  Closing Remarks  o We have begun to mount a sizable response, but the needs are great and response needs to be holistic    We need to halt the infection at the source o This teaches us a broader lesson which is the importance of bolstering public healthcare facilities   This is an important investment to make sure we are prepared for future outbreaks o Fighting the stigma is just as important as isolating the infection at the source"],

The views and forecasts of the group, which consists of senior research staff, may occasionally differ from those disseminated by their research colleagues  Editors: Marcos Arana, Matthew Luzzetti, Rajni Thakur  Financial markets continue to be dominated by speculation over the timing of Fed rate hikes and concerns over the health of the global economy. Growth forecasts have been cut on the margin in recent months, reflecting lower expectations for the second half of the year in the US and a materially weaker outlook for Emerging Markets. The Fed’s focus on external risks in their decision not to hike in September stoked these concerns. Despite these revisions, we don’t share the widespread pessimism. Domestic demand fundamentals remain solid in the US and Europe, and data in China are far from suggesting a sharp slowdown – leaving the world’s three largest economies on reasonably sound footing. EM growth remains a worry, but typical EM crises are unlikely given better external resilience (e.g., higher foreign reserves). Risk assets have rallied in recent weeks as markets have pushed back the timing of the first Fed hike. The interplay between markets and the Fed actually presents a challenge: better data raise the odds of a Fed hike, tightening financial conditions and thus making a hike less likely. This circular interplay is not new however, and has not prevented the central bank from raising rates in the past. But the Fed first needs confirmation that the US economy remains on track and that downside risks to China are limited – something we expect in the next few months. Only then can the Fed more credibly signal that rate hikes are coming, leading the market to price these hikes and limiting the scope of the likely initial adverse reaction. This is still possible by December, but the likelihood has diminished. In the meantime, the Fed’s delay puts pressure on the ECB and BoJ to ease further. We now expect an extension of ECB QE in coming months. While a continuation of recent gains is possible, markets will remain volatile in the near-term as focus narrows on US and China macro data especially. Further clarity on the macro backdrop and path of monetary policy will be needed for the next leg up in risk assets.  David Folkerts-Landau, Group Chief Economist  3   Research Deutsche Bank thehouseview@list.db.com The House View – 14 October 2015, http://houseview.research.db.com   Fed: December hike still possible, but odds of a delay into 2016 have risen. Expect gradual hiking cycle – but market pricing is too gradual   ECB: further easing in Dec. or in Q1, especially if Fed delays hikes. QE extension (beyond Sep-2016) more likely than a deposit rate cut or an expansion of QE   BoJ: on hold; more easing only if inflation worsens  BoE: on hold; first hike in Q2-2016  PBoC: in easing cycle, further (marginal) easing to come – but ready to ease more materially if needed  EM: easing in Asia contrasts with end of easing / start  of tightening cycles in Latin America and CEEMEA   Sharp market corrections / volatility episodes, e.g., on the back of Fed rate hikes  China hard landing: sharper contraction of domestic demand, policy easing proves ineffective  EM crises, driven by China slowdown, stronger dollar  and rising rates, lower commodity prices  Inflation fails to rise sustainably  Political risk in Europe reignites crisis, e.g., elections  (Spain, Portugal), Grexit risk returns   Global growth of 3.1%, as EM slowdown offsets recovery in Eurozone. 2016 at 3.5%  US forecast revised down to 2.4% for 2015, 2.5% for 2016 given external drag, but domestic fundamentals  are solid. Growth remains above potential  Eurozone growth at 1.5-1.6% in 2015-16. Solid domestic demand offsets external weakness  EM growth to slow to 4.0% before 2016 rebound. Weak  growth is a concern across EM, but we don’t expect systemic crises. No sharp slowdown in China   Markets to remain volatile until uncertainty over macro outlook and monetary policy dissipates. Global monetary policy is accommodative even after first hike. We do not see Fed hikes as a policy mistake   Global growth forecasts cut on the margin, but concerns overdone.

Though the information herein is believed to be reliable and has been obtained from public sources believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness.  Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies or otherwise.  Analysts are paid in part based on the profitability of Deutsche Bank AG and its affiliates, which includes investment banking revenues.  Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice.

This report is provided for informational purposes only. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.  Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.  Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the \"Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.  Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the investor's home jurisdiction.

Deutsche Bank forecasts   1 Outlook 2016   Research Deutsche Bank TheHouseView – 13 January 2016 thehouseview@list.db.com http://houseview.research.db.com  TheHouseView – Outlook 2016  The second half of 2015 was difficult for markets. The start of 2016 has not been any easier, with the yuan’s devaluation reigniting concerns over China and global growth. The move comes at a particularly sensitive time: in addition to an uninspiring macro backdrop, the first Fed hike in nearly a decade has added to market anxiety. Oil prices fell to 12-year lows and risk assets sold-off broadly.  The magnitude of the sell-off outside of China appears exaggerated relative to macro fundamentals. We expect a modest rise in global growth in 2016, from the slowest pace post crisis in 2015. The US and European cyclical recoveries continue, and we expect average growth to remain stable, yet unspectacular, in both regions. Other large advanced economies should see growth accelerate. Meanwhile, the outlook in EM remains challenging, but less deep recessions in Russia and Brazil and an acceleration in India should see growth pick up. As for China, while the gradual deceleration continues, fears of a sharp slowdown are overdone. Hardly an outlook worthy of the worst ever start of a year for the S&P500.  The macro impact of the market sell-off is unlikely to push central banks into changing course. The Fed should continue its gradual rate rises, with market pricing converging toward Fed guidance sometime this year. In the case of the ECB, further easing in the near-term is possible given the recent decline in oil prices, but a resilient growth outlook should keep the ECB on hold. Rather, absent further shocks there is more risk in 2016 of focus shifting to discussing a reduction in the pace of easing.  Tactical rebounds in risk assets are possible in the short-term, but a sustainable recovery requires China uncertainty to fade. More generally, markets in 2016 are likely to remain choppy. Dollar strength should continue, though at a more modest pace. US and European rates should rise modestly. In equities, we see 10-15 per cent upside for the US and Europe with both earnings growth and slightly higher valuations contributing to index gains. US credit, especially high yield, continues to suffer from high commodity exposure, and Europe credit should outperform on more solid fundamentals. EM assets will remain under pressure, though we do not expect 1980s-90s style EM crises.

The views and forecasts of the group, which consists of senior research staff, may occasionally differ from those disseminated by their research colleagues   Research Deutsche Bank TheHouseView – 13 January 2016 thehouseview@list.db.com http://houseview.research.db.com   Fed: gradual pace of hiking in 2016, with 3 hikes; pace of hikes to accelerate in 2017. Fed to keep balance sheet flat this year   ECB: QE to continue, more easing possible but unlikely. Risk of focus shifting to QE taper in H2  BoJ: like ECB, QQE to continue but no further easing  BoE: first hike in Q2-2016, but risk of delay is high  PBoC: easing to continue with interest rate cuts (2) and  RRR** cuts to support growth, reduce downside risks  EM: easing bias in Asia contrasts with end of easing / start of tightening cycles in LatAm & parts of CEEMEA   Global growth to pick-up slightly in 2016 to 3.3%, from the slowest post-crisis pace in 2015  US modest recovery continues with growth around 2%. Weak external traction weighs against domestic  strength  Eurozone resilient but unspectacular growth continues (stable around 1.5%), supported by domestic economy  EM growth to accelerate in 2016 (from 4% to 4.4%) on  shallower recessions in Russia and Brazil and acceleration in India. Gradual slowdown but no hard landing* in China   Market turmoil: repeat of August 2015, with fears over China and global growth again rattling markets. Sell-off overdone, but sustainable recovery requires better visibility on China macro and China policies   China FX policy: looking to prevent yuan strength vs. other currencies as dollar rises, not to gain competitive advantage. Further weakness vs. dollar, to keep yuan stable vs. basket   Monetary policy: scope for market pricing of Fed hikes for 2017 and beyond to converge toward Fed guidance. In Europe, further easing less likely than taper talk  Views on key themes  Economic outlook Central bank watch  Key downside risks to our view  Notes: H / M / L indicates estimated probability of risk (High, Medium, Low).

Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.  Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.  Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the \"Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.  Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.

Sustainable economic expansion and demographic transformation are making the insurance market more attractive, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. As the industry rides the wave of growth in this second-fastest growing region in the world,  1 the scale of opportunity is compelling. Low market penetration is giving way to rising consumer  demand and new technologies. In this shifting landscape, organic growth is a greater priority than mergers and acquisitions (M&A) or new products.  Nearly two years ago, EY examined the growth potential for the insurance sector in a number of rapidly growing markets to evaluate their opportunities and risks. We identified those markets that were most likely to offer the best prospects for international growth and investment.  This follow-up report focuses on seven key markets in East and West Africa: Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia in the east, and Ghana and Nigeria in the west. We surveyed 125 insurance executives and regulators in these countries and conducted interviews to gain information, analysis and actionable insights from key executives.  We asked a series of questions to ascertain what is powering the growth of the insurance sector and determine how companies are balancing opportunities and risks. Our findings show that insurers are tracking consumer behavior and technological change in specific markets, and innovation is playing a key role in end-to-end mobile insurance purchases, culture and education. The themes we have identified paint a picture of an industry poised for growth, but still facing some significant challenges.  We hope you find this report insightful as you develop future strategies and consider investment opportunities in the Sub-Saharan African market.

ID Markets, Feb. 2015    | 3  Executive summary  Sub-Saharan Africa is a diverse region that presents risks, challenges and opportunities for the insurance industry. No “one-size-fits-all” approach is likely to succeed across individual markets and countries. This report shares insight into seven countries, each with different growth prospects and potential for investment. Our analysis shows that Zambia ranks first in opportunity, while Kenya is the most advanced of the insurance markets studied.  Our research identified four key themes, which we analyze in depth on the following pages.  Growth Significant population increases, rapidly rising incomes and the relatively low penetration of insurance products suggest huge potential for both life and non-life products. Underlying economic growth will be the most important catalyst for increasing revenue in four of the seven markets we surveyed. New technology is also fueling growth as a new generation of African consumers grows up in a digital age.  Challenges While new technologies can revolutionize customer interactions, finding the right technical talent is not always easy. Moreover, agents and brokers will remain critical to educating populations that have never purchased insurance. Volatility of returns and underwriting capacity were cited as dominant challenges across all countries.  Risks In some markets, an abundance of under-capitalized companies leads to excessive competition around price, rather than service, a situation that could erode consumer trust. Heightened regulatory scrutiny and an increased level of M&A can help alleviate this problem and address the issue of price undercutting. Finding adequate reinsurance, combatting fraud and anticipating macro-economic instability are also part of the business landscape.  Innovation Innovation spawned in Africa, including mobile and cashless payments, could soon disrupt conventional sales channels in the developed world, while creating unprecedented new opportunities to sell coverage across Africa. Mobile phones now drive sales of life, crop and health insurance in a number of key markets, and are expanding into rural areas. As innovation takes hold, there is a need for greater financial literacy and trust between consumers and insurance companies.  Among other conclusions, we learned that:  • Markets in Zambia, Ghana and Kenya will offer the most attractive mix of rewards and risk over the next three years, based on an analysis of such indicators as market size, demographic change and projected growth, as well as macroeconomic and political risk.  • New technologies — mobile, online and collaborative tools — will play a critical role in expanding the market for insurance. Yet these will not easily upend traditional sales approaches.  • Agents and brokers will remain crucial to selling insurance products that are neither tangible nor well understood by Africa’s rapidly expanding middle class.  • Despite the great excitement surrounding micro-insurance, it generates only marginal revenues today. Survey respondents estimate that general insurance and life coverage will continue to account fully for two-thirds of premium revenues in three years, as they do now.  • Consolidation in the marketplace is necessary to build confidence among consumers. The presence of financially weak carriers erodes trust, especially if they are unable to pay valid claims. Regulators may acknowledge the need for further consolidation, but may not always be willing to let foreign insurers control majority shares.   4 | Growth  What’s driving insurance growth in Africa?  From upscale shopping malls to new Western-style housing developments, the dramatic transformation in how people in Sub-Saharan Africa live, work and plan for the future is plainly visible across the subcontinent — and leads to optimistic forecasts for the insurance industry in the region.  Historically, insurance companies focused primarily on South Africa, the continent’s most mature financial market. Life insurance premiums in South Africa accounted for some 88% of total life premiums across the continent in 2013.  2 But since 2010, the Sub-  Saharan economies have consistently ranked among the world’s fastest growing; the World Bank predicts 4.6% regional GDP growth in 2015, rising to 5.1% by 2017. And, at least five African countries now rank among the 10 fastest-growing national economies in annual World Bank reports. In fact, the World Bank now considers Nigeria the continent’s largest economy, ahead even of South Africa. Ghana and Zambia have also moved into middle-income status. These shifts suggest greater potential for insurance sales across Africa than previously estimated.  Foreign investors are recognizing these changing dynamics. Over the past decade, private investors have committed more total funds to Africa than foreign governments or international aid agencies as “official” assistance. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Sub-Saharan region grew by nearly 50%, to US$61 billion in  2014, making the region the fastest growing in the world for FDI.  3  Though South Africa remains the top destination for FDI, total FDI into the country actually declined by 15% last year, demonstrating that foreign investors are diversifying more broadly into other Sub-Saharan economies. While China’s recent slowdown may cause it to reduce its investments in infrastructure and other projects across the region, the longer-term outlook remains very favorable.  Rising incomes and growing affluence make insurance purchases more likely as consumer spending on discretionary items, such as cars, smart mobile phones and health care, expands. “The number of people with disposable income is growing rapidly,” says Matt Lilley, chief executive officer of Prudential Africa, which is building insurance businesses in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda. These consumers “need to think about the future, to plan and save and protect their families,” and that number will grow much faster than GDP, he notes. Prudential’s business will grow at 20% per year in Africa for the foreseeable future, Mr. Lilley predicts.  The digital revolution is also transforming Africa. Just 15 years ago, Ghana, a nation of 20 million, had a mere 50,000 working phone lines. Today, 15 million have access to cell phones, text messaging and the internet. This has enabled innovative micro-insurance programs linked to mobile phone platforms to flourish.  Since 2010, the Sub-Saharan economies have consistently ranked among the world’s fastest growing.  “The number of people who are earning more money than they spend, and have disposable income is growing rapidly.”  – Insurance CEO  Growth  Growth 1  2. “Africa insurance survey,” NKC African Economics, June 2015, ©2015 Oxford Economics.  3. The fDi report 2015: Global greenfield investment trends, fDi Intelligence, http://report.fdiintelligence.com, © 2015 The Financial Times Ltd.   Growth | 5  The low rate of market penetration for insurance is fueling great optimism among executives. Across the seven Sub-Saharan markets, only Kenya offers insurance densities that are ahead of Vietnam, a relatively underdeveloped Asian economy still adapting to capitalism. The potential for significant growth in nations such as Tanzania, Nigeria and Zambia — where few hold insurance coverage — is clearly enormous.  Shifting demographics and changing cultural norms also play a role. Increasing urbanization and the rise of megacities are likely to accelerate insurance sales, as will the declining influence of the extended family as a source of informal insurance, according to James Wambugu, Managing Director at UAP Old Mutual Group. “As people realize that they cannot fall back on their families, and that they should take care of themselves, there are going to be more people buying insurance. That’s fundamental as the social dynamics in our society change.”  Insurers also have the opportunity to extend the capability of groups to help themselves and mitigate risks, by offering forms of group coverage to extended family groups. The experience of insurers in India and Thailand suggest the significant opportunities that a small rise in relative insurance distribution would bring.  Given all of these factors, it is not surprising that survey respondents see a bright future for the industry. There is widespread consensus that “a rising tide comprising good GDP growth and significant opportunity for greater insurance penetration will ‘lift all boats.’” However, rapid growth will not necessarily be profitable in all markets. And insurers must navigate a range of risks and challenges (which we will highlight in subsequent chapters).  Survey findings relative to growth Based on the responses, we identified six contributors to growth:  1 Positive GDP growth across markets  2 Very low insurance penetration — presenting a market opportunity for growth  3 Rapidly growing population  4 Rising consumer demand  5 New technology fueling growth opportunities  6 Organic and M&A opportunities for growth in the sector   6 | Growth  1. Positive GDP growth across markets  GDP growth, cited by 41% of respondents, is expected to be the top driver of premium growth in the near future. In contrast, product innovation was cited by 22%. Product innovation, regulatory change, competition and technological change will also contribute. See figure 1. The outlook for GDP growth is strong across markets through 2018, ranging from 11% in Zambia, to 4% in Ghana and Nigeria. See figure 2.  Clearly, the macroeconomic news is good, despite lower prices for oil and agricultural commodities, and a slowdown in China (one of the most important investors in the region’s resources). Productivity improvements in agriculture, expanding urban markets, shifts to higher-value exports, investments in giant infrastructure projects, and mobile technologies to boost trade and commerce have improved the outlook across much of the continent.

Low insurance penetration  Currently, insurance has low levels of penetration across all of the surveyed markets. In terms of insurance premiums paid per capita, Sub-Saharan Africa significantly lags Thailand, India and Vietnam. See figure 3. Collectively, premiums are less than 3% of GDP. See figure 4. Ghana presents an interesting case study in the background to the development of both the life and general insurance sectors over many years. This slower growth has led to the most balanced distribution between major sectors of all the countries surveyed. However, even there the distribution penetration levels overall are still low.  From this low base there is significant upside. Premium growth is projected to reach 11% in Zambia and 10% in Nigeria through 2018. Even Kenya, the most mature insurance market included in the survey, is expected to achieve a compounded annual growth rate of 6% through 2018. See figure 5.  The potential to increase life insurance sales is particulatly noteworthy. In most of the seven Sub-Saharan markets studied, non-life insurance premiums represent at least 65% of the total premium income. See figure 6. Tanzania and Uganda are at the higher range, both 88%, followed by Zambia at 70% and Kenya at 65%. Ghana (54%) is the most balanced of the insurance markets and is worthy of closer study. These findings highlight the potential opportunities to expand life insurance sales in most markets.

Rapidly growing populations  Larger populations and the movement of people from rural to urban areas will also promote growth for insurers. The dramatic increase in populations seen since 2000 is unprecedented. No region of the world in human history has ever reported faster population growth in absolute terms. See figure 7. And it will continue. As both infant mortality and fertility rates decline over the next 20 years, Sub-Saharan Africa will add many more people to the globe’s labor force. By 2035, the number of Africans joining the working-age population (ages 15–64) will exceed that from the rest of the world combined.  Booming urbanization will also transform the continent. African cities are the fastest growing on the planet; megacities, such as Lagos and Nairobi, are becoming important economic factors in their own right.  4 By 2030, for example, the population of Lagos  is projected to double, making it Africa’s largest city, while Dar es Salaam’s growth will average 4% annually. 5 Clearly, cities hold a  great promise for insurance market growth.

Rising consumer demand  Rising consumer demand is another building block. Survey respondents ranked it above 50% in all seven countries, with Ghana (94%) and Nigeria (88%) citing it as number one on their lists. See figure 8. This is largely a function of an expanding middle class, with more disposable income. This cohort is becoming more aware of the value of insurance products as its spending on health care and discretionary items also increases.

New technology  Survey respondents cited technology as one of the most significant enablers for growth. See figure 8. But they also believe it is one of the industry’s biggest challenges. The critical technological capabilities encompass a portfolio of tools, systems and processes, including:  • Online and mobile underwriting platforms for policy quotations and renewals  • Distribution channels that enable online and mobile purchase of policies and premium payments  • Online and mobile claims processing and customer claims payment  • IT software and hardware to accommodate anticipated future bandwidth of data — thus facilitating data analytics, risk-based pricing and data warehousing  Insurers that can leverage such technology will be better able to capitalize on cross-industry collaborative insurance products, another key building block for growth, according to 75% of survey respondents. See figure 9. Almost the same number cite online and mobile underwriting platforms, which makes sense given that a new generation of African consumers is growing up “digital” and use their mobile phones to conduct financial transactions.  The opportunities being created through online underwriting platforms are particularly significant for respondents in Zambia, Uganda and Malawi, who see online underwriting platforms as particularly promising. Respondents in Malawi, Uganda and Tanzania are likely to prioritize mobile underwriting.

Organic growth and M&A opportunities  Given the background of favorable GDP growth and opportunities to increase penetration in the market, it is no surprise that respondents expect that growth will continue to be mainly organic going forward. Five of the seven countries cite organic expansion as the most likely source of revenue growth over the next 12-15 months. See figure 10. Two-thirds of respondents in Uganda ranked M&A at the top of their list.

Top three ranked responses    Growth | 11  Seizing the growth opportunities While the insurance outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa is undeniably bright, insurers must be prepared to seize the opportunities. Face-to-face sales, through skillful agents and knowledgeable brokers, will still carry the weight of insurance sales in the region in the medium term. In all seven markets, agents and brokers account for at least 50% of policies sold, because consumers still need to be educated as to the importance of insurance coverage.  Insurance is an intangible product, so consumers who are not financially savvy “don’t understand why they would pay a premium. And, if there was no claim, why did they not get anything back?” says Ashok Shah, group CEO of Apollo Investments Ltd. in Nairobi. “That’s something very difficult to them to understand.” Agents play a key role in that education process.  Despite the excitement surrounding the potential for micro-insurers to reach a large and underserved market, survey respondents say that general insurance coverage will contribute 37% of total revenues from gross written premiums, while life insurance will represent 25%. Health insurance will grow from 31% to 33% of gross written premiums. Micro-insurance will increase only fractionally.  Many executives note that as African societies change, consumers now must become more self-reliant. “People realize they cannot fall back on their heritage, and they must now take care of themselves,” says James Wambugu, Managing Director of the UAP Old Mutual Group in Kenya. “People are going to become more independent as societies urbanize, and that is going to help generate more need for insurance.”  Selling Sharia-compliant insurance products to Muslim communities is another challenge requiring the expertise of agents and brokers. Many are optimistic that takaful products will gain greater acceptance, but it requires insurers to develop specialist channels to explain different products to Muslim or Christian clientele. “It’s very hard to cross-sell these products,” Mr. Shah notes, “and there has to be significant training to sell both kinds of products.”  The industry faces an interesting conundrum in terms of designing the right mix of distribution options to most effectively and efficiently increase the penetration of insurance services going forward. It remains to be seen if there will be a real breakthrough in the electronic mobile delivery of end-to-end services. See figure 11.

Across the seven countries surveyed, the central issues were strategies and tactics to access talent, increase market penetration, improve education and build greater trust for the industry. These concerns will determine the extent to which the industry will be able to take advantage of the extraordinary growth opportunities it faces.  When entering a rapidly growing market, “human resources are almost always the major constraint, because your business grows faster than your ability to recruit and train people,” says Mr. Lilley, CEO of Prudential Africa. “Either that or it grows faster than the capabilities of your people.”  The need to adopt the latest technologies also presents real hurdles. Mobile, online and collaborative tools can help the insurance industry expand, but making these offerings “user friendly” requires real technical expertise. Not only must companies recruit agents who can sell products to customers, but also technologists who can build mobile and web applications geared to insurance, since mobile platforms can open channels to those never before covered, Mr. Shah says. “We want to see if we can leverage technology” to sell more personal lines of coverage and micro-insurance products, he notes.  Distribution challenges are the flip side of those related to technology. In Sub-Saharan Africa, people sell insurance to people, which places more stress on the need for qualified staff and underscores the opportunity to achieve more efficient distribution through mobile and digital channels. The experience of MicroEnsure in Ghana also suggests that using mobile as a market differentiator can be a powerful tool to boost market entry.  Fragmentation and overcompetition can also hamper the industry’s growth, a concern reflected in the survey responses about regulation. For instance, companies that confront solvency issues can undermine consumer trust through their reluctance to pay out legitimate claims. In other markets, price competition means service lags, and regulators cannot sufficiently police deficiencies. The general consensus is that regulators need to develop a more orderly and reliable marketplace by helping consolidate weak players, encouraging mergers or prompting foreign investors to bring their expertise into the marketplace so that competition can be focused more on service than on price alone.  Culture and education also clearly matter — and present challenges to insurers. Insurers still have work to do in educating consumers as to the benefits and value of insurance products. Health insurance — which can help meet the health care needs of a large, underserved population — will be critical to demonstrating such value.  When entering a rapidly growing market, “human resources are almost always the major constraint, because your business grows faster than your ability to recruit and train people.”  — Matt Lilley, CEO, Prudential Africa  Growth  Challenges 2   Challenges | 13  Survey findings relative to challenges Survey respondents identified seven “top-of-mind” challenges:  1 Availability of talent  2 Volatility of returns for shareholders/stakeholders: underwriting capacity  3 Technological capacity  4 Distribution  5 Regulation  6 Culture and education  7 Innovation  1. Availability of talent  Recruiting and retaining the right people are critical concerns. As the insurance industry expands across the region, lack of talent has become a critical issue. Indeed, 30% of total respondents in our survey admit that it is difficult to find qualified agents, particularly in Nigeria and Kenya. See figure 12.  But similar concerns exist across markets. “In a country like Uganda, our biggest challenge is finding qualified staff,” Mr. Shah says. While in Kenya, “we need a staff that is quite specialized in sophisticated products.” Insurers must also battle the threat of brain drain: “In a lot of cases, the talent we like to hire as country managers was schooled abroad and then came home,” says Peter Gross, Marketing Director for MicroEnsure. Like other insurers, he struggles to keep trained actuaries from decamping for the UK or South Africa. Beyond actuarial, there is a shortage of talent across several key areas, including sales and distribution, marketing and technology.  Figure 12: Insurers face challenges finding qualified talent   19%  45%  20%  42%  13%  23%  40%  19%  53%  45%  42%  47%  15%  25% Ghana  Kenya  Malawi  Nigeria  Tanzania  Uganda  Zambia  … qualified agents. ... qualified actuarial/financial staff.  ... qualified marketing staff. ... qualified insurance operations staff.  …. qualified customer service staff.  To what extent do you agree with the following statements? It is difficult for my firm to find ... Top two responses   14 | Challenges  2. Volatility of returns for shareholders/ stakeholders: underwriting capacity  While there are variations across individual national markets, it is no surprise that in the comparatively young insurance market of Sub-Saharan Africa, volatility of returns and underwriting capacity scored high. These were the dominant challenges across all countries, while suitability of reinsurance was considered the lowest overall. Shareholder demands are the highest concern in Tanzania (58%) and Uganda (80%). In contrast, Kenya’s main concerns are underwriting capacity and the economic outlook, both at 41%.  3. Technological capacity  Technological changes and the need for advanced technology are also buffeting the back office. Mobile and web-based customer interactions increase the potential for companies to use data analytics to customize and price products, yet integrating sales, operations and claims departments can prove difficult. It is worth noting that these are also challenges for insurers in mature markets.  4. Distribution  Face-to-face sales matter and people still sell insurance to people. In fact, in all seven markets, our survey indicates that agents and brokers account for at least 47% of policies based on premiums. See figure 11. This suggests that there are significant opportunities to widen the reach and become more efficient by using mobile and online technology to deliver education and solutions. In Tanzania, 22% of gross written premiums comes from direct mail — more than from any other market in the survey. Agents are also important to health insurers, accounting for 29% of their premiums.   Challenges | 15  5. Regulation  The timing and implementation of regulatory changes top the list of regulatory-related challenges. See figure 13. In countries such as Ghana, Malawi and Tanzania, respondents are most concerned about the ability of regulators to implement regulatory changes, while Kenya, Zambia and Nigeria are more concerned about the expected timing of regulatory changes.  Respondents to our survey, as well as the regulators in each country we interviewed, recognize the need to develop a more common framework of regulation across the region. There is a need to build trust in the insurance industry, promote wider financial inclusion and deeper knowledge of what the insurance industry can offer the wider public as part of genuine risk mitigation strategy. We explore these themes further on page 26.  6. Culture and education  Respondents made clear that education and building trust are critical going forward, particularly in regard to informing a population that remains largely unaware of the value of insurance. The intangible nature of insurance means that companies need to educate the general public about the benefits of coverage. Without a claim as a touch point with the customer, it can be difficult to demonstrate such value.  Credibility issues arise in some markets from legacy insurers that lack financial viability. Insurance brands often do not command high trust in African markets, and some players are collaborating with mobile phone providers or banks to build credibility. Regulators need to be more vigilant, though sometimes they find it difficult to “pull the plug” on companies that do not meet industry standards.  7. Innovation  Innovation was also cited as a challenge (as well as an important driver of growth). Given that both lack of advance technology and sufficient talent were cited as challenges, respondents believe innovation will be difficult to achieve. See chapter 4 for more findings and analysis relative to innovation.

The overall macroeconomic climate across Sub-Saharan Africa is buoyant, but not without its own uncertainties. Companies keen on entering the region must do so with their “eyes open” and be cognizant of potential issues that could affect their investment strategies in a continent still facing serious development challenges. Here are some examples:  • Sharp declines in oil and minerals prices in the past year raise doubts about the growth prospects for recent stars, such as Nigeria and Ghana.  • Political risks and uncertainty remain across the region. Nigeria faces insurgency in the country’s impoverished northeast while Kenya’s government continues to battle terrorist violence. In Uganda, government reform uncertainty clouds the economic outlook.  • Trust of financial service providers is generally low across the region. Some providers are slow to pay out verified claims, while fraud remains a concern in parts of the region. “There are unethical practices going on in the marketplace, and when no action is taken against those who breach the regulations, consumers lose trust in the insurance sector,” notes one CEO.  • The recent volatility in global markets may lead to a slowdown of investments, especially from China, in infrastructure and other large resource-centered development. In some nations, for example, large mining projects have either been shuttered or investments delayed.  The potential for the insurance industry to achieve dramatic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa over the next three years is significant. But these risks should not be underestimated. As other emerging markets, such as Brazil and South Africa, face short-term obstacles, the case for investment in Sub-Saharan Africa should become increasingly attractive.  Survey findings relative to risks Survey respondents identified six critical risks:  1 Country risk  2 Capital risk  3 Distribution risk  4 Regulatory risk  5 Underwriting risk  6 Reinsurance risk  Growth  Risk 3   Risk | 17  1. Country risk  It is notable that respondents commented that each country is subtly different to do business in, not least because of differences in regulatory focus. See the individual country chapters for more detail about specific risks by country.  2. Capital risk  Capital risk relates to the risk that insurance companies face in relation to current and future capital or shareholder funds. Having a capital framework or strategy and monitoring its progress is a prerequisite for profitable growth. A full 73% of respondents rated organic growth as the most important factor influencing their company’s capital position vs. 58% for regulatory requirements. See figure 14. In terms of strategies to mitigate capital risks, 72% cited additional corporate funding and 70% cited financial and business partnerships.

Distribution risk  When it comes to distribution channels, concentration risk — cited by 82% of respondents as important or somewhat important — tops the lists. Concentration risk, which involves lopsided exposure to a particular group of counterparties, is especially important in Tanzania and Malawi. Fraud is another important concern, cited by 73% of respondents, and of particular concern to respondents in Malawi and Kenya. See figure 15. Tanzania, Uganda and Malawi expressed more concern about identifying qualified staff and poor logistics and infrastructure than others.  6  In seeking to mitigate these risks, training of staff is viewed as the most important means. Data sharing with regulators was also widely cited, along with efforts to continually examine and review distribution and marketing policies. See figure 16.  “The industry will only grow as fast as the number of decently trained insurance advisors grows,” says Prudential’s Mr. Lilley, as complex policies demand personalized sales. “Recruiting and training, recruiting and training. Repeat until dead. That’s what it’s about. We’ve recruited and we’ve trained over 1,000 agents in Ghana in the last 18 months,” he adds, “and that actually takes a lot of time.”  Figure 15: Sources of distribution risk  82%  Concentration risk  73% Fraud  51% Poor  logistics and infrastructure  41% Lack of qualified staff  How important are the following distribution risks associated with writing busi-ness in the short and medium term?

Because responses are ranked according to “top two” choices, the responses add up to more than 100%.   Risk | 19  4. Regulatory risk  Survey respondents are most concerned with the immediate and practical aspects of regulatory requirements (cited by 80% of respondents), including reporting and regulating types of investments held. See figure 17. Notably, capital requirements were considered least important (cited by 64%), providing further evidence that an insurer’s first priority is to resolve short-term regulatory requirements.  Respondents have a wide range of strategies to mitigate these regulatory risks. Improving internal audit and review functions and external consultation ranked high at 74% each. Closer engagement and external consultation are helping to address the reporting and investment requirements set by the regulator.

The ideal framework is one that enables trust, inclusion and knowledge. See figure 18. The development and implementation of risk-based supervision, risk-based capital requirements and minimum capital requirements are a few of the important steps in building trust. Markets are in various stages of progress and maturity in these areas. At the same time, various consumer education initiatives and regulations around Takaful and micro-insurance products are promoting inclusion and knowledge.  Across the various markets there is a varying level of inherent mistrust of the insurance industry. This is sometimes due to unethical practices, treating customers unfairly or a result of economic downturns that negatively impact the industry. A framework is required to ensure the protection of consumers, promote trust between consumers and insurance companies and educate the population.  Figure 18: Key regulatory themes  Insurance penetration This is a key issue for all the regulators who are currently implementing various strategies to increase insurance penetration in their respective countries. An example of common initiatives include insurance education including policy holder protection to improve insurance industry perception.  Regulatory guidelines on micro-insurance and Takaful A number of countries have introduced key micro-insurance and Takaful regulations in the last few years. This reflects the different nature of the micro and Takaful insurance business, e.g., Nigeria, Kenya,  Risk-based supervision Most of the countries are in the process of implementing risk- based supervision, with Kenya and Ghana leading in the maturity of the implementation.  Risk-based capital requirements A few counties are in the process of introducing and implementing risk-based capital requirements. This includes introduction of key regulation around corporate governance and risk management, e.g., Kenya and Ghana. This is being done in piecemeal basis.  Credit risk A number of countries have introduced “no “no premium no cover “ policies over the years. This has lead to a significant decrease in the credit risk within the various countries, e.g., Nigeria and Ghana  Minimum capital requirements Most of the countries have recently reviewed or are in the process of reviewing the MCR, e.g., Kenya, Ghana, Zambia and Malawi.  Trust  Inclusion  Knowledge    Risk | 21  5. Underwriting risk  Underwriting risk relates to the chance that insurers may incur greater risk than expected at the time of pricing and selling insurance products to consumers. In the long-term, this translates to a non-profitable book of business for the insurer.  Unexpected claims volatility and expenses that run higher than predicted are the most significant underwriting concerns in the eyes of respondents. This suggests that insurers should invest more in analytics. See figure 19. Nearly 80% of respondents cite unexpected volatility in claims as having an “extremely” or “somewhat important” impact on underwriting risk. The same number cites expenses that run higher than anticipated. Concerns about claims volatility are especially elevated in Malawi (90%), Kenya (86%) and Zambia (85%), while expense concerns are ranked highest in Tanzania (100%) and Uganda (93%).  As macroeconomic volatility can derail global credit markets, insurers are mindful that they must pay close attention to their ability to obtain reinsurance. 80 percent of respondents identify the availability of cover as “extremely” or “somewhat important,” closely followed by “inflexible terms and conditions.”  6. Reinsurance risk  Reinsurance risk refers to the risks that an insurance company faces from reinsurance arrangements that were not expected at the time those arrangements were undertaken. A total of 80% of respondents cited availability of coverage as the most important reinsurance risk in the short and medium terms. More than half thought that volatility in premiums charged was of greater importance. See figure 20.  Figure 19: Sources of underwriting risk  79%  Unexpected claims volatility  79%  Higher expenses than expected  62%  Changes in competitors’ premiums  42%  Weak terms and conditions  How important are the following underwriting risks to your firm in the short and medium term?

Yet today, the rapid adoption of mobile phones is dramatically altering the equation, as digital disrupters are helping generate growth of the insurance market in sectors that might have been underserved in the past.  When it comes to innovation, most survey respondents conceive it in terms of inclusion, the role of technology and, in particular, the use of mobile. These issues were not apparent in other areas of insurance where we typically would have expected innovation, such as motor insurance. This is the largest line of business and is compulsory across most markets. It is riddled with fraud and unprofitability, and yet, survey respondents did not cite many examples of innovative changes.  It is also clear that companies are not currently implementing mobile end-to-end insurance purchases — a startling finding given the relatively high mobile phone penetration in various countries, most notably Kenya and Nigeria. We acknowledge that insurance companies have cited technological capabilities as a future source of growth.  Innovation in education also was lacking. There is a clear need for greater financial literacy and trust between consumers and insurance companies. We identify this area as a true opportunity to promote the insurance industry in a positive light, deliver customer needs and improve the overall customer experience in the process.  Finally, fraud is endemic in various lines of business across all of the countries covered in the survey. Innovative measures in fraud detection and mitigation were notably absent in our findings. Again, this is a significant investment opportunity for insurers to optimize their source of premium income to remove “bad risk.” By collaborating and working together with other insurers and regulators, companies can positively impact their bottom-line results.  Survey findings relative to innovation:  Survey respondents were asked to identify the top two areas of innovation in their countries. Online and mobile underwriting platforms were consistently high across the board. See figure 21. But the diversity of responses underscores the range of opportunities. The emphasis is clearly on using innovative technology to find new customers.  Tanzania was the only country to mention mobile claims processing platforms, while Nigeria and Ghana listed cross-industry collaborative insurance products among their top choices.  Growth  Innovation 4  “No one wakes up in the morning wanting to buy insurance. But we are convinced that people wake up in the morning worried about the risks they face.”  — Richard Leftley, CEO, MicroEnsure   Innovation | 23  Figure 21: Top areas of innovation by country  The top two areas of innovation selected by country are:  Cross-industry collaborative insurance products  Ghana Marketing  Mobile underwriting platforms  Kenya  Online  underwriting platforms  Cross-industry collaborative insurance products  Nigeria  Online  underwriting platforms  Mobile  underwriting platforms  Tanzania  Mobile claims processing platforms  Data analytics Uganda  Online  underwriting platforms  Online  underwriting platforms  Zambia  Mobile underwriting platforms  Mobile underwriting platforms  Malawi  Online  underwriting platforms    24 | Innovation  Innovation is taking hold The many examples of innovation in the region are worth detailing:  Micro-insurance  Every customer likes the word “free.” For microfinance specialist MicroEnsure, the best way to rapidly build an insurance business for the rising middle class across Sub-Saharan Africa is to offer free life coverage through cell phone providers.  “No one wakes up in the morning wanting to buy insurance,” says Richard Leftley, MicroEnsure’s CEO. “But we are convinced that people wake up in the morning worried about the risks they face.” The key is “to keep your products and processes really, really simple,” he says.  MicroEnsure partners with cell phone carriers and offers basic life and health insurance as free add-ons to their mobile service. While coverage is minimal, it encourages customer loyalty for carriers, and helps MicroEnsure identify potential clients for premium-level accounts or other types of insurance. And the concept seems to be working: in less than one year, the company signed up more than one million customers in Ghana, and now serves more than eight million clients across the region.  “We can change customer behaviors regarding insurance,” says Peter Gross, who runs marketing for MicroEnsure from a base in Nairobi. In markets where competition for SIM card purchases is so fierce, “a free insurance offer that says ‘spend a little bit more than you spend today and get free insurance’ is compelling to people.”  MicroEnsure is also making inroads with both crop insurance and the pioneering use of so-called decongestion insurance — which compensates operators of roadside kiosks if their space is seized for a construction project. Building a “direct to consumer” business is the company’s next great challenge. “To develop the right kind of revenue consistency, we need to go directly to the customer,” notes Mr. Gross. “So we need to build products that are pricy enough to justify agent sales, but not so pricy that we price ourselves out of the market. That’s our next focus.”   Innovation | 25  Agricultural insurance  Agriculture remains Africa’s largest economic sector, so developing insurance products to help farmers better manage their risks represents a real opportunity. One innovator, UAP Old Mutual Group, launched a mobile-based, cashless insurance plan for farmers called Kilimo Salama (or “Safe Agriculture”) to insure against drought and excess rain. In partnership with Safaricom, the mobile telecom operator, and an agricultural foundation, Sustainable Agriculture, the program insures a farmer’s inputs — such as seeds, fertilizers and chemicals — rather than harvests. It uses weather data collected at remote monitoring stations to track rainfall, and pays out based on a predefined formula of rainfall requirements for crops.  “We use our index to insure our small-scale farmers, and then use the mobile phone, so that when they pay out, the money automatically goes to the farmer through their phone,” explains Mr. Wambugu of UAP Old Mutual Group.  Livestock — index insurance  One of the largest sources of income for lower income families is livestock. APA insures livestock throughout Kenya. Rather than insure the death of an animal, the coverage is based on whether the animal has enough food to graze on. The insurance trigger is dependent on the inches of forage on the ground, which is measured by sophisticated satellite technology.  Health insurance  Hospitals and health care workers already use text messages to routinely check up on their patients. In the same way, the mobile phone is becoming a powerful platform for selling health insurance.  In Nigeria, a pan African telecom provider offers “hospital cash” coverage, a single payment for customers who are hospitalized for three days or more. Customers who spend NGN1,000 (US$5) a month on telephone credit earn NGN100,000 in life coverage and NGN10,000 in hospital cash coverage for the following month, while those spending NGN5,000 earn NGN250,000 and NGN25,000 of coverage, respectively. Users can pay to extend coverage to family members.  In Kenya, a joint venture of Safaricom, Britam, and Changamka, a micro-insurance program, created a health coverage plan called Linda Jamii for those without access to health insurance. For a payment of about US$120 per year, clients receive nearly $2,800 in coverage for hospitalizations, outpatient benefits, compensation for lost income because of hospital stay, and funeral assistance. All transactions were carried out through the m-Pesa mobile payment platform. Due to high unit costs, the product is no longer sold to individuals (but the focus is now on group coverages) — an example of where pricing is as important as innovation.     26 | Matrix  To sell insurance across Sub-Saharan Africa, no “one-size-fits-all” approach is likely to succeed. Instead, it is vital to disaggregate individual markets to identify the highest opportunities as well as the lowest potential risk. This matrix measures opportunity and risk across the seven countries included in our study. See figure 22. The size of the circle represents the overall projected size of each nation’s insurance market in 2018, based on forecasts developed by Oxford Economics.  Our analysis shows that Zambia ranks first in opportunity, followed by Nigeria (though Nigeria has much greater risk). Malawi, by contrast, ranks lowest for opportunity. Kenya is the most advanced of the insurance markets studied here, while Nigeria is the least developed on a GDP basis.

The opportunity rankings include these elements:  • Growth potential in insurance premiums based on macroeconomic forecasts from Oxford Economics. These forecasts are based on such factors as labor force changes or projected growth in earnings. Other determining factors include a country’s potential for import substitution and the percentage of the population that is Muslim (since countries with a higher Muslim population represent potential greater opportunities to sell takaful).  • An assessment of the supply-side environment combines scores of a country’s technological development, strength of financial sector, development of business environment, capacity for innovation and abundance of human capital. Data sources used in this analysis include the World Bank, World Economic Forum, Google, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Heritage Foundation.  The risk ratings reflect these components:  • An economic risk rating, based on data from Fitch, Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Coface, the World Bank and ONDD (Belgian Export Credit Agency)  • A commodity risk rating, based on UNCTAD data of countries’ dependence on commodity exports  • A corruption risk rating, based on scores assigned by Transparency International, which publishes an annual Corruption Perception Index  • A political risk rating, developed by Oxford Economics using World Bank and worldwide governance indicators  • A legal and regulatory risk rating, based on World Bank and World Economic Forum indicators  A matrix of risk and opportunity  Our analysis shows that Zambia ranks first in opportunity, though Kenya punches “above its weight class.”  Opportunity risk-matrix analysis (Rank 1 = best; 7 = worst)  Opportunity index Risk index  Ghana 3 1  Kenya 4 3  Nigeria 2 7  Zambia 1 2  Tanzania 6 4  Uganda 5 5  Malawi 7 6   28 | Country insights   Country insights | 29  Kenya Tanzania Uganda Zambia Malawi Nigeria Ghana  Insurance premium  2014  Market size (US$b) 1.8 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.1 1.8 0.4  Density (US$ per capita) $39.0 $6.4 $4.6 $18.2 $5.3 $10.0 $15.5  % GDP 2.9% 0.9% 0.6% 1.1% 1.5% 0.3% 1.1%  2018  Market size (US$b) 2.2 0.4 0.2 0.4 0.1 2.6 0.6  Density (US$ per capita) $44.4 $7.6 $5.6 $24.5 $6.2 $13.22 $19.7  % GDP 2.6% 0.9% 0.7% 1.1% 1.4% 0.4% 1.3%  2014—2018  Market size (US$b, % growth) 6.0% 7.9% 8.2% 11.3% 7.7% 10.0% 8.5%  Market size (US$b, change) 0.5 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.8 0.2  Country insights 6  Each of the seven markets is examined in brief, highlighting their unique opportunities and challenges.  Insurance premium at a glance   30 | Country insights  Kenya Kenya is the hub for commercial activities across East Africa, and Nairobi, the region’s megacity, houses much of the services and managerial talent deployed in neighboring Uganda and Tanzania. Strong growth is expected in Kenya’s telecoms and information technology sectors, as well as in financial services and retail trade. Capital inflows are strong. The government has sold billions of dollars in bonds recently to finance infrastructure projects. Kenya also possesses strong trade links with its neighbors and with the European Union, which accounts for 24% of Kenya’s exports.  In 2014, Kenya generated insurance premiums of US$1.8 billion (the largest in Sub-Saharan Africa outside of South Africa), and Oxford Economics expects the Kenyan insurance market to grow to US$2.2 billion by 2018.  Non-life insurers dominate the Kenyan market and collect two-thirds of total premiums. Nearly half of non-life covers are generated from automotive insurance. Almost another quarter comes from health. Given the relative prosperity in Kenya, insurance penetration remains small, suggesting major opportunity for expansion. Fraud may be one reason insurance acceptance is so low: 95% of Kenyan respondents cited this as a key risk associated with expanding their businesses.  Kenya has also been a leader in developing its M-PESA mobile money platform. A number of insurers already employ it to fund basic insurance coverage, though some executives doubt it can ever replace the traditional system of using agents and brokers for higher-priced or more sophisticated covers.  Already the most mature among the seven countries in our survey, significant upside potential exists in Kenya. During the first quarter of 2015, premiums grew by 16.4%, according to the Insurance Regulatory Authority. And for all of 2014, gross direct premiums grew at more than 20%. People in Kenya today “have more and better understanding of insurance and its role,” says Mr. Wambugu of UAP Old Mutual. “There is a lot more competition and knowledge. The playing field is becoming more level.”  Respondents from Kenya were more likely to see regulatory changes as potential drivers for growth over the next three years and more likely to say mobile underwriting platforms would be important innovations driving growth — more so than cross-industry collaborations. They were also less likely to view volatility of return or shareholder demands as top challenges. Health insurance was also more often cited as an important source of additional premium revenues.  Conclusion: solid economic growth and a cashless payment system make Kenya ripe for robust gains for insurers.  Given the relative prosperity in Kenya, insurance penetration remains small, suggesting major opportunity for expansion.

In line with overall economic performance, Oxford Economics projects annual growth in insurance premiums of 7.9% through 2018.  Less than 20 years ago, Tanzania was a socialist economy that essentially banned private land ownership. As a result, the insurance market is relatively young and small: just US$300 million in premiums annually. By 2018, the market should reach US$400 million, with per capita density still small, at US$7.60 (up from US$6.40 in 2014). Many observers hope the central bank will legalize the bancassurance model to increase premium growth and insurance penetration.  Despite Tanzania’s robust expected growth, insurance is expected to remain below 1% of GDP in 2018. Reflecting the rural and agricultural character of the country, the pace of insurance growth will rank fifth among the seven countries analyzed here. The country’s low credit rating also means that some providers find it difficult to get adequate reinsurance from international carriers.  Half of industry respondents from Tanzania in our survey cited “technology changes” as the most important driver of growth in premiums over the next 12–18 months, far more than in any other country. They were also far more likely to focus on volatility of return and shareholder demands as top challenges affecting the insurance market.  Tanzania respondents were also more likely to cite mobile claims processing as important innovations. The relatively less-developed technological infrastructure and the growing pains of the financial sector are also likely to affect growth.  Despite these challenges, Dar es Salaam is being touted as Africa’s next megacity and is today among the fastest-growing urban centers in Africa: its current population of about 4.1 million is expected to expand by more than 85% through 2025, according to the African Development Bank.  Conclusion: rapid urbanization will generate growth, and lessons from the mobile market in Kenya can also help catalyze opportunities.

Today, insurance penetration is less than 1% and represents just 0.6% of GDP. Uganda’s insurance market is driven by an agency network that accounts for an estimated 60% of premiums.  Coming off a small base, Uganda’s insurance market will grow at the fourth-fastest rate in the seven-country pool: 8.2% annually through 2018. Premium volumes were US$200 million in 2014, and per capita density was US$4.60. Even robust growth will bring density per capita to US$5.60 by 2018, according to Oxford Economics forecasts.  Ugandan respondents were somewhat more likely to point to overall economic growth as a driver of insurance growth, and were far more likely to cite shareholder demands as a top challenge. They were also much more likely to cite data analytics and cross-industry collaboration as the most important innovations to generate future growth.  The Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) of Uganda supervises the industry and is attempting to cut red tape; it recently announced that a new online system will reduce the time agents need to receive licenses from the IRA from two weeks to two days. Nevertheless, composite insurance companies are not permitted under Ugandan law, meaning life insurers must be separate from non-life companies. New IRA rules are clearly on the minds of respondents: 53% of Ugandan respondents say understanding regulatory changes represents their biggest challenge, more than in any other country.  The threat of terrorism also looms over Uganda, and political risks as well as high inflation have weakened the currency. These uncertainties coexist with favorable prospects for regional trade and improvements in human capital, as educational opportunities expand in Kampala and other major cities. With inflation expected to continue at a moderate 5%–7% annually over the next four years, insurance companies might find the increasingly sophisticated and well-heeled Ugandan urban middle class an attractive target.  Conclusion: bancassurance distribution networks and mobile insurance products are expected to drive future growth.  Uganda’s insurance market will grow by 8.2% per year through 2018.

A young nation, it is also relatively urbanized. Today about 40% of the population lives in cities — higher than any nation in the survey except for Nigeria and Ghana.  The insurance market is relatively small, totaling US$300 million in premiums as of 2014, but growth is expected to exceed 11% per year to 2018 — the highest rate of the seven countries in our study. While copper mining is important to the overall economy, Zambia has recently experienced double-digit growth in financial services, telecoms and construction. As a result, Oxford Economics projects per capita premium density to reach US$24.50 by 2018, up from US$18.20 in 2014 as the insurance market expands by 11% annually.  Between 1971 and 1991, the Zambia State Insurance Corporation operated as a monopoly, but following privatization in 1992, the number of insurance companies expanded rapidly. Today, consolidation is helping the industry grow on a firmer footing: the number of insurance brokers decreased to 39 in 2015 from 48 in 2014, and insurance agents have decreased to 222, down from 279 in 2014. “With increased competition has come choice of company and products for policyholders and relatively affordable premiums,” Zambia’s Pensions and Insurance Authority declared in its most recent annual report. “Players are also being constantly challenged to be innovative and come up with new products that meet the demands of Zambians.”  Respondents in Zambia believe that cross-industry collaborations and online underwriting platforms will help spur additional growth, but indicated they have great difficulty finding qualified agents and marketing staff. They are also more likely than other respondents to believe underlying economic growth will stimulate expansion more than product innovation.  Conclusion: strong projected economic growth and relatively low risks make Zambia an attractive market, even if its market size is smaller.  Growth of the Zambian insurance market is expected to exceed 11% per year to 2018 — the highest rate of the seven countries in our study.

Oxford Economics estimates premiums in 2014 at just US$100 million, and per capita density equaled only US$5.30. A strong growth rate of 7.7% annually from 2014 to 2018 is projected, however, which should push per capita density to US$6.20.  The modest size of the market is also represented in the relatively small size of the respondents in our survey: 90% reported gross written premiums of US$10 million or less and were the most likely to cite a lack of qualified staff (80%) and fraud (100%) as key distribution risks. Our survey indicates that internal growth of the country’s economic output and product innovations are likely to be the key drivers of growth. Respondents were far more likely to cite “technological capabilities” as a top challenge affecting the industry, an indication of the overall lack of technological sophistication in this market.  Automobiles continued to dominate the general insurance business, representing about 57.3% of gross premiums. Fire was the second-largest class of insurance, with 15.5% of premiums. MicroEnsure has established operations in the country in collaboration with cell provider TNM Moyo, which reported paying out US$90,000 in burial insurance to 259 people in the first year.  7 The modest size  of the market means MicroEnsure provides smaller amounts of coverage, the company acknowledges. 8  The Federal Reserve Bank, the regulator, appears to monitor the sector closely. In its most recent annual report, the bank listed the names of every single insurance agent in the country — and provided detailed financials on all aspects of the industry. Malawi is home to seven general insurance companies, four life insurance companies and one reinsurance company. The country has 21 insurance agencies. The market for life insurance is dominated by two companies, Old Mutual and NICO.  The government has acknowledged that the country may have too many insurers with difficulties maintaining minimum solvency requirements and thus may need recapitalization in order to underwrite larger risks and boost their underwriting results.  Conclusion: a small market, Malawi’s growth will trail others.  Automobiles continued to dominate the general insurance business, representing about 57.3% of gross premiums in Malawi.  7. “TNM Moyo Cover pays K50.8m in funeral claims,” Nyasa Times, 14 July 2015, www.nyasatimes.com/2015/07/14/tnm-moyo-cover-pays-k50-8m-in-funeral-claims, ©2015 Malawi Nyasa Times.  8.

Oxford Economics projects the insurance market will grow at 10% annually from 2014 to 2018, reaching US$2.6 billion annually in premiums, up from US$1.8 billion last year. Density per capita is projected to rise to US$13.20 in 2018 from US$10.00 in 2014.  Nigeria’s insurance industry is undercapitalized, fragmented and too small to take on larger risks, according to a June 2015 analysis from NKC African Economics. Nigeria is home to 17 life, 32 non-life and 10 composite insurers, but companies report the regulatory authority is more compliance than risk focused.  Recent data from the country’s regulator, the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), shows that more than three million Nigerians today hold some form of insurance, up from fewer than one million in 2007. Coverage rates vary, however, with higher levels for property and automotive insurance and a low take-up of personal policies, such as life or health.  The government expects premium volumes to triple by 2017. One example of low-hanging fruit: of the seven million vehicles registered in Nigeria, fewer than one million are believed to have adequate insurance. The government hopes that making automotive insurance mandatory will boost the non-life portion of the industry, which already depends on vehicles for more than half its volume.  Respondents to our survey expect product innovation and rising consumer demand, rather than overall economic growth, to be the principal driver of growth. Some 33% of Nigeria respondents cited product innovation and rising demand as keys to future growth, vs. 22% of the overall sample. Nigerian survey respondents were also more likely to cite affordability of coverage (42%) as a top challenge than overall respondents (27%), and more likely to cite health insurance as a top revenue stream.  Clearer policy directives and government regulations are critical to creating lift-off for the insurance industry. As nearly half the population of Nigeria is Muslim, the potential for takaful to expand insurance penetration is evident, but not all of the operational guidelines necessary to expand in this direction have been established.  In our survey, Nigerian companies were especially sensitive to regulatory changes as a catalyst for growth but also cited organic growth as an important driver. Innovations can be expected in the market, however. Already, MicroEnsure has entered the market with a cell phone carrier , offering insurance to subscribers who buy at least NGN1,000 (US$5.00) of service every month. Other companies are attempting to use bancassurance distribution models to expand their footprint and branch infrastructure.  Conclusion: a new government must prove its credibility to boost economic growth, amid the collapse of oil prices, while harnessing takaful can be major opportunity.  As nearly half the population of Nigeria is Muslim, the potential for takaful to expand insurance penetration is evident.

Petroleum output is expected to double by 2021, to 250,000 barrels per day, while cocoa exports approach US$3 billion annually. The country is also an important producer of gold.  Today just one in 10 Ghanaians own any kind of insurance; only one in 20 has health insurance and a majority of policies are sold directly. Brokers and agents each hold about 25% of the market.  Yet growth has been impressive, and Oxford Economics projects the size of the insurance market to reach US$600 million in 2018, compared to US$400 million in 2014, or 8.5% annual growth. Ghana has also been the focus of innovative foreign investors who have harnessed the fierce competition among cell phone providers to offer free insurance as a market differentiator.  As a result, product innovation was cited as the top driver of economic growth, far more than overall economic expansion. Respondents from Ghana were also more likely to cite regulatory conditions as a key challenge. Health insurance was the only category in which respondents expected to see higher premium returns than the overall sample.  Ghana’s insurance industry today is fragmented. Local competition is based mostly on price, not on service, and as a result there is a “trust gap” for some insurers.  In June 2015, the National Insurance Commission (NIC) reported 21 life insurance companies, 25 non-life companies, three reinsurance companies and 69 brokers operating in the country — along with 6,000 insurance agents. The insurance act of 2006 laid a new foundation for the industry and led to significant regulatory changes. In 2014, the NIC began implementing a “no premium, no cover” policy, aiming to prevent insurers from providing cover before customers have paid their premiums. According to regulators, the need for the policy became necessary because of “huge amounts” of delinquent premiums. The regulator also has demonstrated support for a micro-insurance program, which can greatly expand the customer base.  The favorable regulatory and business environments represent fertile grounds for an expanding insurance market. A requirement for commercial buildings to have fire insurance, which was expected to spur purchase, has been poorly enforced, so that growth, while rapid, has not achieved expected levels. Another potential boom niche is funeral insurance as the country has experienced a boom in lavish funerals. Funeral insurance, in turn, can help companies build accompanying insurance products.  Conclusion: the pioneering role of micro-insurance in Ghana can lay the foundation for more education, and more demand, for conventional insurance products.  Oxford Economics projects the size of Ghana’s insurance market to reach US$600 million in 2018, compared with just US$400 million in 2014.

Rising economic opportunities and the potential for mobile technologies to create relatively frictionless financial connections mean more potential customers than ever before can be served by insurance companies. But face-to-face sales conducted by skilled agents and brokers will remain important.  Consumer education will also be critical, as many consumers in these rapidly growing markets have never been taught the values that insurance offers. Investments in software programmers and mobile interface engineers will matter, as will training of customer service representatives and actuaries.  This overview suggests some important ramifications for those seeking to boost their insurance revenues in the region:  • Focus on cities first. Africa’s cities are locomotives of growth and home to most consumers of life and non-life products. As African societies change, consumers are now being more self-reliant, hence the need to buy insurance.  • Educate consumers. Consumer education will be crucial. The biggest competitors for insurers will not be other companies as much as the implicit practice among Africans to “self-insure” against loss — because they feel the market cannot replace personal relations when it comes to protecting themselves against life’s setbacks.  • Invest for the long term. The initial success of innovative programs that harness mobile phones to market and sell insurance suggests Africa could become a major “test bed” for innovative insurance programs that could also be used in the developed world. Savvy companies will not only have to invest in sales and training of brokers, actuaries and customer service representatives, but also software engineers and experts in developing mobile interfaces. The customers of the future, who are just beginning to think about purchasing insurance, are “digital natives,” and companies will need to demonstrate digital fluency.  • Regulatory framework. It is critical that the framework is improved in order to support the growth of trust, inclusion and education about the value of insurance in the rapidly growing economies represented by the seven countries surveyed in this report.    | 47  EY Africa Insurance Team  Steve Osei-Mensah East and Central Africa Financial Services Advisory Leader Nairobi, Kenya +254 736 111011 steve.osei-mensah@ke.ey.com  Shaun Crawford Global Insurance Leader London, UK +44 207 951 2172 scrawford2@uk.ey.com  Trevor Rorbye Africa Insurance Advisory Leader Cape Town, South Africa +27 21 443 0290 trevor.rorbye@za.ey.com  Colin Daley West Africa Financial Services Advisory Leader Lagos, Nigeria +234 703 910 6008 colin.daley@ng.ey.com  Martin Bradley Global Insurance — Finance, Risk & Actuarial Leader London, UK +44 20 7951 8815 mbradley@uk.ey.com  Sujay Shah East and Central Insurance & Actuarial Advisory Leader Nairobi, Kenya +254 73 3862529 sujay.shah@ke.ey.com  Sarah Karuri East and Central Insurance & Actuarial Manager Nairobi, Kenya +254 20 2715300 sarah.karuri@ke.ey.com  Alex Thomson Africa Actuarial Services Leader Johannesburg, South Africa +27 11 502 0679 alex.thomson@za.ey.com  Sumarie Greybe Africa Actuarial Services — General Insurance Leader Johannesburg, South Africa +27 11 502 0681 sumarie.greybe@za.ey.com  Fatima Badat Africa Insurance Services — Senior Manager Johannesburg, South Africa +27 72 111 1112 sumarie.greybe@za.ey.com   Section title  48 |   Section title  | 49   EY | Assurance | Tax | Transactions | Advisory  About EY  EY is a global leader in assurance, tax, transaction and advisory services.

We hope it will interest those who make decisions about allocating resources globally and those looking to deepen their understanding of the drivers of insurance growth and profitability in all regions.  The report begins by summarizing the most important developments of 2013 and 2014. These two years were very eventful ones for the industry, marked by strong growth in Life and Health, steady development in P&C, and increased profitability in Life and P&C.  The report then provides a perspective on the industry’s three lines of business: Life, P&C, and Health. What is driving the rebound in growth and profitability in Life and will this continue? Which product categories and geographies are still growing in P&C, and how have new risk categories had an impact? How attractive is Health and what are the prospects for this segment in emerging markets?  We conclude our paper by providing a perspective on competitive dynamics, drawing on the global and local insurer databases that we recently added to our GIP Markets Database.  Some notes on our approach: In general, our detailed analysis focuses on data through 2013. We have selective data available for 2014 based on preliminary reports. The forecasting tools developed as part of McKinsey’s GIP service line were used to assess how the insurance industry might respond over the next decade to global macroeconomic shifts. Our “consensus scenario” assumes a recovery of GDP growth in coming years in addition to steadily increasing interest rates. The results reported in this report reflect the output of this model.  We hope you find this report useful and thought-provoking. Please contact us if you would like to discuss any of the topics it raises.  Devin McGranahan Insurance leader Americas  Vivek Agrawal Insurance leader Asia Pacific  Stephan Binder Insurance leader Europe, Middle East & Africa   6  In 2014, the insurance industry staged an impressive recovery, with anticipated global growth of 6.3 percent - far exceeding the 2.8 percent reported in 2013 - and total premiums reaching EUR 3.8 trillion. Growth in 2014 was also notable because it was higher than nominal GDP growth for the first time in five years.  What factors help explain the industry’s strong performance? Preliminary reports suggest that Health showed the highest growth, while Life demonstrated a strong recovery in growth of gross written premiums (GWP) from 2013 to 2014. Growth in P&C insurance remained relatively stable, at a decent 5 percent. Early reports also show that emerging markets grew significantly more than mature markets (12 percent vs. 5 percent), mainly because of their lower penetration levels and higher nominal GDP growth. The only two regions experiencing double-digit growth were Emerging Asia and Latin America.  As in previous years, the penetration rate for mature markets (8 percent) far exceeds that of emerging markets (3 percent). This pattern will continue, since the growth seen in emerging markets is not yet strong enough to largely surpass nominal GDP growth and thus to increase penetration.  At the product level, preliminary reports revealed some important trends:   Life. Most regions saw positive Life growth in 2014, but the amount of the increase, as well as the factors responsible, varied by region. In a marked departure from 2013, the US, Japan and Mature Asia demonstrated the strongest gains. Of all Life products, endowments experienced the most growth, primarily because of a resurgence in sales at Italian banks, but unit-linked products also performed well. Life Return on Equity (RoE) rose from 11.5 percent in 2012 to 12.7 percent in 2013 as equity markets were strong.   P&C. Growth in the P&C market held steady in 2014, coming in at 5 percent. The main growth drivers were Motor in emerging markets and Fire and Property in mature markets. At the regional level, growth was stable, except for a significant slowdown in Eastern Europe. As in 2013, Emerging Asia and Latin America are driving most of the P&C growth. For profitability, P&C RoE increased in almost all regions in 2013, reaching 11.5 percent globally.    Health. The Health segment grew 8 percent in 2014, up from 5 percent annually in the two previous years. Emerging markets are rapidly gaining share and should account for about 8 percent of global premiums in 2014 (up from 5 percent in 2008). Emerging Asia and Latin America achieved the most growth, at 31 percent and 23 percent, respectively. The US is also expected to contribute strongly to growth as the Affordable Care Act is raising the number of insured. Globally, the net combined ratio for Health has been under 100 percent, on average, for the last decade, with emerging markets generally reporting higher numbers than mature markets.  We describe major trends for all product lines using final data for 2013 and earlier years, as well as preliminary reports for 2014 (H1 or Q3). In general, our most detailed analyses focus on the final data through 2013.  Executive summary   7  Competitive dynamics  US and European insurers, which once ruled the global ranks, have been steadily losing ground to Asian companies as emerging markets grow and mature markets slow down. Although both US and European companies have expanded into emerging markets, they have faced many challenges and still depend on the slow-growing mature markets for most of their business. Their struggle will likely continue, since local insurers are becoming more competitive.  Most insurers have managed to improve their RoE in recent years, but the largest insurers are not necessarily capturing a disproportionate share of profits in Life and Non-Life in all countries, as our analysis in this paper will show. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have been declining across all regions, mostly because companies lack available free capital. A reversal of the downward trend is not observed yet, as several challenges to consolidation still need to be addressed, however, there are some fundamental factors in place that could help increase M&A activity over the long term.   8  About McKinsey’s Global Insurance Pools (GIP) GIP features a proprietary Markets Database containing over 150,000 data points covering the largest 64 countries worldwide and 99 percent of global insurance premiums. It includes key financial indicators for every market, from 2000 to the present, and projections to 2020.  The forecasts in this paper are based on a consensus macroeconomic scenario provided by Oxford Economics, and the informed judgment of McKinsey’s experts. The Oxford forecast assumes average global nominal GDP growth of 6.3 percent for 2014 through 2020 (compared to 5.4 percent for the previous decade) and a gradual increase in interest rates (which some would consider an optimistic view). The scenario does not include potential macroeconomic and regulatory threats. For further methodological details, please refer to the Appendix.  New additions to GIP GIP recently expanded to include information on individual insurers. It now provides integrated data on selected global and local insurers and information on performance benchmarking.  Individual insurer databases. These include:   Local Insurers Database, including key financial indicators for the top 15 largest local insurers in 11 individual insurance markets, as well as premium data for the 10 largest insurers in more than 50 countries globally  Global Insurers Database, including key financial statement information for over 100 major global insurers, including their split for Life and Non-Life.  Note: the GIP Markets Database leverages data published by local regulators, which often follow local accounting standards. The Global Insurers Database leverages annual reports, which mostly follow standards of the International Financial Reporting Systems. This means that the Markets Database reports an RoE on average ~2 points higher than that in the Global Insurers Database, since local accounting standards allow for more favorable valuation of assets and liabilities. The 2013 RoE data in this paper is from the Markets Database.  Performance benchmarking. GIP’s tailored performance benchmarking allow insurance companies to compare themselves to their peers. This in-depth analysis covers capital markets performance; financial performance for total business, Life, and Non-Life; and country-level performance.  More detailed information on the GIP initiative can be found in the Appendix.  How GIP supports our clients McKinsey’s Global Insurance Pools can help insurers along several dimensions. A “Granularity of Growth” analysis can identify a company’s specific drivers of growth; our databases can also help to benchmark the company’s growth and profitability against market performance and competitors and identify the impact of different macro-economic scenarios on growth and future market shares.  McKinsey offers a subscription to the database giving unlimited access to all data points.   9  Recent developments in the global insurance industry  The year 2014 should provide welcome relief for the insurance industry, with early data suggesting that premiums have grown 6.3 percent worldwide, reaching EUR 3.8 trillion 1.  This premium growth is well above the 2.8 percent reported in 2013 and also exceeds GDP growth for the first time in five years.  The industry’s strong performance primarily stems from improvement in Life (EUR 1.8 trillion in premiums), which is expected to have experienced 6.4 percent growth in 2014, compared to 0.6 percent in 2013. Health premiums are also expected to see greater growth in 2014 at 8.0 percent, reaching EUR 0.8 trillion, while P&C premium growth should remain stable at a decent 5 percent, reaching 1.2 trillion. (Exhibit 1)  Regional growth patterns  Only two regions saw double-digit growth in 2014: Emerging Asia (15 percent) and Latin America (13 percent). These results helped give emerging markets an overall growth rate of 12 percent. Growth in mature markets, although solid, is lower at 5 percent. Unlike the past few years, mature markets should see the greatest share of absolute growth (70 percent) in 2014.

When looking at growth patterns, we found that industry penetration rates in mature markets have been fairly stable over the last decade, with an increase in Health compensating for declines in Life and P&C. (Exhibit 3) In emerging markets, the industry penetration rate generally rose over the same period, with approximately equal growth reported in all three product lines. There was, however, a somewhat significant drop in Life in emerging markets in 2011, when accounting and regulatory changes in India and China pushed sales down. Although Life penetration has not yet returned to its pre-2011 peak, it has been relatively stable and expected to return to growth in the coming years.  Penetration rates in mature markets remain higher than those in emerging markets. This limited convergence, however, does not show the full picture in emerging markets, where a more detailed analysis - for instance, one based on socioeconomic class or geographic location - would reveal that certain subsegments are experiencing rapid growth. As one example, urban areas are experiencing greater increases in penetration rates than rural areas.

The 2014 growth rate is also significantly higher than the 1 percent reported in 2013, when large declines in the US and Japan drove the entire market down.  Regional growth  Our 2014 reports suggest that Life saw growth in all major markets for the first time in years. (Exhibit 4) Some regions, however, fared better than others because of market-specific factors. An examination of regional trends revealed the following:    Western Europe’s growth of 7 percent surpassed the 6 percent reported in 2013 largely because of the strongly rebounding Italian market. In 2011 and 2012, Italian banks were suffering from a liquidity crisis and focused on selling deposits and other banking products, rather than Life, to increase their own funding. In 2013, as funding needs diminished and interest rates decreased, they again began selling more Life products, and this trend intensified in 2014. Consumer demand for Life has been strong because lower interest rates have renewed interest in managed products.    Eastern Europe saw the market decline 2 percent in 2013, while in 2014, there was 0 percent growth. A double-digit decline in Poland was largely responsible for the market’s poor performance. (The sharp decrease there mainly resulted from the government’s attempt to discontinue a specific short-term product that is exempt from capital gains tax).  A perspective on Life insurance  Life has grown in all regions except Eastern Europe and Africa in 2014  World  9  Japan  Africa  North America  Latin America  7  -8  4  5  23 Mature Asia2  60  1 Eastern Europe  19  Emerging Asia3  Western Europe  14  0  15  31  34  11  4  0  3  Life GDDPW abs. growth 2011-12, EUR bn Life GDDPW abs. growth 2012-13, EUR bn  Life GDDPW abs. growth 2013-14E1, EUR bn  2  109  0  2  10  16  28  45  11  1 Preliminary figures 2 Mature Asia includes: Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan 3 Emerging Asia includes: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Middle East  -1  4  5  14  2  26  10  17  4  6  8  -8  0  -5  7  -2  14  1  7  14  3  9  4  3  0  -6  6  Growth rate, Percent  Exhibit 4   13   Growth in North America came in at 3 percent in 2014. This is significantly up from the 8 percent decline reported in 2013, when the industry had to deal with two factors: a restructuring of the variable annuity business of local insurers and a normalization effect in Group Life. (In 2012, two large pension plans transferred to insurers, resulting in a one-off premium jump in 2012, followed by a drop in 2013). The return to growth in 2014 was also driven by an improving economy, combined with growing consumer demand.   Japan’s Life sector has been volatile in recent years. Growth declined in 2013 after a reduction in the guaranteed rate and a decline in the sales of lump-sum premium payment policies, but recovered strongly in 2014 because of two developments. First, capital markets were strong in Japan, generating high demand for investment products. Second, the devaluation of the yen trigged more interest in products denominated in foreign currency.   Other Mature Asia (including Oceania) also saw a recovery in 2014, with an anticipated 9 percent growth (up from 0 percent in 2013). The strong returns were mainly driven by three markets:  — Australia benefitted from higher inflows into group superannuation. This was largely driven by one player almost quadrupling its single-premium sales, but all players experienced double-digit growth in Group Life as underwriting pressure increased prices.  — In South Korea, growth returned to normal after a decline in 2013 that partly resulted from new regulations eliminating tax benefits for immediate annuities. South Korea’s 2013 growth was also low because of stagnant growth of savings products due to an ongoing low interest rate environment.  — In Taiwan, growth temporarily increased because the government instituted new criteria for Life policies, particularly premium-rate flexible annuities, in August 2014. Since consumers expected the new policies would be more expensive or offer fewer benefits, GWP jumped early in the year.    Emerging Asia’s 2014 growth of 14 percent comes after several years of low or negative growth in a few large markets. China is the largest source of the growth, with premiums increasing about 17 percent. China’s resurgence is linked to the government’s promotion of traditional protection products and the rebound of the tied agent channel. India also witnessed double-digit growth in 2014, which comes after few years of low or negative growth that largely resulted from poor sales of unit-linked products. A recent restructuring of these products, however, made them more popular again, which resulted in a return to growth in 2014.   Latin America was one of the strongest regions in Life for several years, but growth decreased from 7 percent in 2013 to 3 percent in 2014. This poor showing primarily occurred because unit-linked sales in Brazil (~70 percent of total Life market) fell by about 8 percent between 2012 and 2014 in response to capital-market volatility and regulatory changes. Other Life products, however, continued to grow, and Brazil’s long-term prospects look strong.   14   Africa is expected to show a decline in Life in 2014, after years of robust but volatile growth, because of slow economic growth, high unemployment, and an unstable labor market. While these factors have been an issue for several years, their impact was less significant during 2012 and 2013 because the affluent segment was relatively unaffected by the economy during that time. Furthermore, unit-linked products were in strong demand in Africa in 2013 because of favorable equity markets. At this point, however, the economic problems are so severe that they are significantly decreasing sales in the affluent market as well as the mass market.  Product growth  Of all Life products, endowments saw most growth in absolute terms in 2014. (Exhibit 5) Their gains mostly resulted from the resurgence in Life sales at Italian banks, which serve as the primary distribution channel for endowments in that country.  Unit-linked products also made a strong contribution to growth in 2014 because strong worldwide equity markets increased demand. It should be noted, however, that the market effect is somewhat more muted in recent years than it was from 2004 through 2007, when stocks were also performing well. (Exhibit 6) Several factors could be limiting the recent growth of unit-linked products. First, consumers need to regain trust in these products in the aftermath of the capital-market crash, especially given the prolonged unstable economic and financial climate. Second, several country-specific trends may have posed obstacles:   In the US, players have been restructuring or discontinuing their variable-annuity business in recent years because of market volatility and low interest rates. Japan  Endowments made the strongest contribution to growth in 2014, largely because the Italian market was strong  5 Mature Asia3  42  Japan 4  North America  Eastern Europe  16  Latin America  0  Emerging Asia2  2  Western Europe 30  1  Total Mature  0  Total Endowments  17  Africa  Total Emerging  58  52  4  9  -1  7  29  0  72  28  0  EUR billion EUR billion Global growth share  Percent  Life premiums absolute growth 2013-2014E1  Endowments premiums absolute growth 2013-2014E1  1 2014 figures based on available H1 or Q3 reporting 2 Emerging Asia includes: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Middle East 3 Mature Asia includes: Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan  11 Term Life  Unit Linked  Annuities  58  16  10  Endowment  15  Total Life  Group Life  109  Exhibit 5   15  has experienced market changes similar to those in the US, with unit-linked premiums dropping 70 percent between 2007 and 2013.   In India, more stringent regulations on sale of unit-linked products has resulted in a continued decline in premiums since 2009.   Although some European markets, such as France, still aggressively push unit-linked products, others have shifted their focus to new guarantee concepts, including unit-linked with guarantees. And, although not very pronounced, Solvency 2 seems to have pushed unit-linked growth somewhat in Europe.  Protection products (Term Life) continued to perform well, showing the highest growth rate over the last 2 years (7 to 8 percent annually). Protection is one of the few remaining Life products with limited competition from non-insurance players and generally has a higher margin.  Profitability  RoE for Life was 12.7 percent in 2013, up from 11.5 percent in 2012. The strong equity market, which experienced a 20 percent global TRS (Total Return to Shareholders) in 2013, was the primary driver behind this increase. For 2014, RoE should come in 1 to 2 percent lower, although the capital markets are still performing well, with double digit TRS (over 17 percent). This is in line with the trend seen in the 2014 published results from the top 40 global players.

(Exhibit 7) Mature Asia, however, saw profits decline to the level of cost of equity (CoE), largely because Taiwan experienced a one-time valuation adjustment resulting from a change in accounting methods. Africa and Latin America also saw RoE decline, although it remained above CoE. In Western Europe, RoE increased for the second consecutive year, since equity markets are strong and Solvency 2 regulation does not yet have its full effect.  Growth forecast  Life is not expected to continue the strong growth seen in 2014. Penetration levels are decreasing in mature markets, and Emerging Asia is the only region where they are rising. Overall, mature markets should see annual growth rates of 3 percent between 2014 and 2020, while emerging markets will see growth of about 12 percent annually. Given the relatively small share of emerging markets - they only represented 17 percent of global Life premiums in 2014 - their growth will not compensate for the slowdown in mature markets.  Many regions experienced an increase in RoE in 2013, but Mature Asia, Latin America, and Africa saw a decline Life Insurance; Percent  Western Europe North America Mature Asia1 Japan  Eastern Europe Latin America Emerging Asia2 Africa  1 Mature Asia includes: Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan 2 Emerging Asia includes: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Middle East  -10  0  10  20  30  12 11 13 05 08 10 03 07 09 06 04  0  30  -30  10  20  03 05 09 13 11 10 06 04 12 08 07  -10  0  10  20  30  07 13 11 10 06 09 05 03 08 04 12  -10  0  10  20  30  08 07 13 11 10 12 09 06 04 03 05  -10  0  10  20  30  03 12 11 08 06 10 09 13 04 07 05  -10  0  10  20  30  13 11 08 12 09 06 04 03 07 10 05  -10  0  10  20  30  13 12 11 08 07 10 09 04 03 06 05  -10  0  10  20  30  05 03 06 13 11 12 0910 08 04 07  Cost of Equity  Return on Equity  Exhibit 7   17  A perspective on P&C insurance  Growth in the global P&C market continued to be very steady. It was 5 percent in 2013 and came in about the same in 2014. At the product level, Motor showed the most growth, driven mostly by Emerging Asia. (Exhibit 8)  Regional growth  At the regional level, growth has generally been stable for the past three years in Western Europe, Africa, North America and Japan. (Exhibit 9) Other regions, however, saw more dramatic changes:   In Eastern Europe P&C growth was significantly lower in 2013 because the region’s economy was suffering. The same trend is seen in 2014. In Poland, for instance, motor premiums fell 5 percent in 2013 and continued to fall by 3 percent in 2014.   Growth significantly dropped in Other Mature Asia (including Oceania) from 2012 to 2013, but that reflects normalization in the wake of earlier price increases related to bad weather. From 2013 to 2014, growth has stabilized.   Emerging Asia and Latin America experienced the strongest growth in 2013 and continued to do so in 2014. Growth is mostly driven by Motor, which still represents ~60 percent of the total P&C market in these regions.    Motor contributed about half of absolute growth for P&C, driven mostly by Emerging Asia  1 Preliminary figures for 2014 2 Mature Asia includes: Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan 3 Emerging Asia includes: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Middle East  10  26  Africa 0  Emerging Asia3  Mature Asia2 1  0 Eastern Europe  Latin America 6  Japan  7 North America  1  Western Europe 0  Total Emerging 17  Total Mature 9  Total Motor  1  28  3  1  3  39  1  35  65  24  EUR billion EUR billion Global growth share  Percent  Absolute growth P&C premiums 2013-2014E1  Absolute growth Motor premiums 2013-2014E1  Total P&C  Motor  Other P&C 6  58  Liability 10  Fire & Property  26  Accident 4  12  Exhibit 8   18  Product growth  Motor, which represented over 40 percent of global P&C premiums in 2013, remains the largest product line in P&C. This segment also saw highest absolute growth in 2013 – a trend that continued in 2014. In emerging markets, Motor was responsible for 60 percent of absolute growth from 2008 through 2013, making it by far the largest growth driver. In mature markets, Motor was only responsible for 30 percent of absolute growth over the same period, with Fire and Property making a much greater contribution.  Although Motor is still the most significant product in mature markets, its share of premiums fell from 45 percent in 2000 to 39 percent in 2013, and this trend is expected to continue. Two factors can help to explain this trend. Motor expenses have continued to grow, mostly driven by inflation and an increasing number of vehicles on the road. However, the increase in expenses per vehicle has remained well below inflation because of operational efficiency and the rise of the direct channel in many countries. Secondly, claims frequency and severity differs by country. However, there has been a general trend toward a reduction in frequency, and this should continue as technological advances, such as automatic-braking systems, lane-change assistance, and ultimately self-driving cars, reduce the accident rate. (Exhibit 10) The full impact of these improvements is still very uncertain and will depend on a number of factors, including the replacement rate for cars and regulations for self-driving cars, which can vary greatly between countries.

For instance, cyber risk only accounted for 0.04 percent of European P&C premiums in 2013 (excluding the UK). Although the category is projected to grow 30 to 40 percent annually until 2018, it will still only represent 0.2 percent of premiums by that year. The situation is similar in the US, where cyber risk only accounted for 0.3 percent of P&C premiums in 2013. Given the low market share of new risk categories, we do not expect these products to fully compensate for the limited growth of Motor in mature markets.  Profitability  P&C RoE increased in all regions except Africa, reaching 11.5 percent globally in 2013. (Exhibit 11) The increase was mostly driven by a favorable capital-market environment, since some regions witnessed an increase in net combined ratio in 2013. In the US, RoE was finally able to rise above CoE in 2013, driven by improved underwriting results, a low incidence of natural disasters or other catastrophes, and higher investment returns.  Growth forecast  P&C growth is expected to remain stable, at about 5 percent annually until 2020. Emerging markets will show the highest growth, around 13 percent annually, while mature markets will only show growth of about 3 percent. Penetration rates in emerging markets are not likely to converge to the current levels in mature markets, but rather increase modestly, while mature markets will see penetration rates slowly decrease.

In 2014, we anticipate 8 percent growth.  Regional growth  Emerging markets are rapidly gaining share in the Health sector. In 2014, they accounted for about 8 percent of global premiums, up from about 5 percent in 2008. Growth in Mature Asia and Africa was fairly stable in 2014. (Exhibit 12) For the other regions, consider the following:   The US market saw a sharp increase in growth from 3 percent in 2013 to an anticipated 8 percent in 2014. The main drivers behind the increase are the launch of the Affordable Care Act, which is raising the number of individuals with private health insurance, and premium inflation. Since the US accounts for two thirds of global Health premiums, it serves as the primary growth driver for the global Health sector.   The markets experiencing the most growth in 2014 are Emerging Asia (31 percent) and Latin America (23 percent). These markets also experienced the most growth in 2012 and 2013.    Western Europe’s growth fell from 4 percent in 2013 to 3 percent in 2014. In this region, three countries—the Netherlands, France, and Germany—represent over 75 percent of the market, and some developments there are constraining growth. For instance, the Dutch market is expected to have grown 2 percent in 2014 (versus 4% in 2013) because  Emerging Asia and Latin America show highest growth; US is largest contributor to growth  4  World 34  Japan n/a  Eastern Europe 0  0  Mature Asia2 3  Western Europe  Africa  4  21 North America  2 Latin America  Emerging Asia3  32  n/a  0  3  15  3  0  5  5  Health GDDPW abs. growth 2011-12, EUR bn Health GDDPW abs. growth 2012-13, EUR bn  Health GDDPW abs. growth 2013-14E1, EUR bn  n/a  0  59  8  1  3  4  4  39  1 Preliminary figures 2 Mature Asia includes: Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan 3 Emerging Asia includes: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Middle East  5  21  18  3  7  6  11  n/a  5  3  24  23  4  7  10  6  n/a  5  8  31  23  3  6  10  9  n/a  8  Growth rate, Percent  Exhibit 12   22  of new regulations capping health expenditures, as well as an increase in co-payments. Similarly, German growth will fall because of new regulations that strictly limit eligibility for private health insurance.    Eastern Europe showed strong growth, going from 6 percent in 2013 to 9 percent in 2014, but the market remains very small.  Profitability  Globally, the net combined ratio for the Health sector has been under 100 percent, on average, for the last decade. (Exhibit 13) There are major geographic variations, however, with emerging markets experiencing much greater volatility than mature markets and typically reporting a higher net combined ratio. This pattern is the opposite of that in P&C, where the combined ratio is about 4 percent lower in emerging markets than mature markets. The difference in volatility may occur because regulations typically cap or prescribe profitability in Health in mature markets, but not in P&C. In addition, the Health segment is still in its early stages in emerging markets, and there will be much volatility as all stakeholders, including regulators, insurers, and consumers, adjust to the new environment.  Growth forecast  Following the pattern of the last few years, emerging markets will continue to gain share in the Health market, increasing to about 17 percent by 2020. Two trends are responsible for this rise: the ongoing efforts of mature markets to control healthcare expenditures and increased attempts by emerging markets to capture opportunities related to private health insurance.

They allowed us to examine company-specific trends for the first time in 2014, as well as to aggregate data and draw conclusions about insurers at a global and local level.  The growth of emerging markets, combined with the relative slowdown in mature markets, has had a major effect on company performance. US and European insurers, have been very slowly but steadily losing ground to Asian companies. (Exhibit 14) In keeping with this trend, Asia accounted for 5 companies in the top 15 in 2013, up from three in 2008 and two in 2003. In a related development the global market share of the top 15 groups declined from 25 percent in 2003 to 23 percent in 2013. This trend is also apparent at the national level, with the market share of top companies declining in various countries.  Challenges facing foreign players in emerging markets  Although European and US insurers have expanded into emerging markets, they have faced many challenges and still depend on the slower-growing mature markets for most of their business. Those European and US players that have established a solid presence in emerging markets are still facing intense competition from local companies, and many have difficulty capturing a larger share of the market (with a number of exceptions, obviously). (Exhibit 15)  Many challenges that foreign insurers face relate to local regulations. For instance, the market share for foreign companies in the Chinese P&C market has been under 1 percent since 2008, partly because of a regulation stating that foreign companies can only sell P&C  Competitive dynamics  The global concentration of the top 15 players has decreased in the last decade Total global business (NPE), Euro bn  18 CNP  Prudential UK 18  UnitedHealth 20  Kaiser 22  Zurich1 30  State Farm 35  Nippon Life 36  Munich Re1 36  Zenkyoren 37  ING 38  Aviva 38  AIG 42  Generali 45  Allianz1 54  Axa 62  2003 2008 2013  Market share of top 15  23.1 24.7 25.1  1 Premiums captured as reported in P&L and exclude UL business for certain players: Allianz (2013: 43bn); Munich Re (2013: 23bn) Zurich (2013: 13bn)  34 Zurich1 Kaiser 35  State Farm 37  Aviva 39  Munich Re1 39  Nippon Life 40  Zenkyoren 44  Anthem 44  ING 45  AIG 48  UnitedHealth 57  Allianz1 65  Generali 67  Japan Post 71  Axa 88  33 PICC  Nippon Life 36  Zurich1 36  Prudential UK 38  State Farm 42  Kaiser 45  Japan Post 46  Zenkyoren 46  China Life 48  Anthem 51  Munich Re1 52  Generali 64  Allianz1 71  UnitedHealth 84  Axa 85  Americas  EMEA  APAC  Exhibit 14   24  insurance in a limited number of provinces, making it difficult to capture a share of China’s motor insurance business. This policy is enforced by making companies purchase licenses (maximum of one each year). Some positive changes are occurring, however. For instance, foreign insurers have been allowed to sell Motor TPL (Third Party Liability) since 2012, and M&A activity has increased recently.  Local regulations are also a challenge in India, another rapidly growing market, where the law historically stipulated that foreign partners could only have a 26 percent ownership share in local companies. Since 2008, there was a plan to increase this to 49 percent and foreign players entered the market at that time with the assumption that this increase would soon be announced. However, it took 6 years for this change to occur, and it was only implemented recently. (Regulations still stipulate, however, that ultimate control of the company needs to remain with the Indian partner).  Profitability  Most insurers have managed to improve their RoE in recent years, but the largest insurers are not capturing a disproportionate share of profits in Life and Non-Life in all countries. In fact, insurers that ranked among the top five had an above average RoE for total business in 7 out of the 11 countries we investigated, and in four countries, they underperformed. Product mix does not seem to be a performance differentiator for profitability, since the results were roughly similar for Life and Non-Life. (Exhibit 16)  In Life (and to a certain extent in P&C), scale may convey limited benefits because each insurer has many local entities that operate somewhat independently (often driven by  Local players in emerging markets still largely dominate, while multinationals struggle to increase their presence Market share of foreign vs domestic players (Total business)  1 Shift from Foreign to Joint-Venture due to move from Mapfre to create a JV with Banco do Brasil 2 Data for earlier historical years not available  China  Brazil1  India  Russia2  95 95  2013 2008  4 1 1 4  72 70  30 28  2008  0 0  2013  74 70  21 26  2013 2008  9 0  81 79  10 11  2011  9  2013  10  Joint-Venture (foreign-local)  Local  Foreign  Exhibit 15   25  country-specific regulations). But even at the country level, scale benefits are confined to certain areas. For instance, scale may reduce administrative expenses but it has no effect on commissions. Given the limitations of scale, other factors are more likely to affect profitability, such as the amount of legacy, product mix, and channel mix.  M&A: recent trends and predictions  A review of the last six years shows that the number of mergers and acquisitions was highest in 2009 (235 deals) and 2011 (221 deals). Beginning in 2012, M&A activity has shown a steady decline across all regions, reaching a low point in 2014. (Exhibit 17) The main factor behind the decrease is the scarcity of capital in the industry, and limited appetite from investors to allocate more capital. A reversal of the downward trend is not observed yet, as several challenges to consolidation still need to be addressed, such as limited cross-border synergies, local ownership structures, new regulations (such as Solvency 2) and a tough macro-economic environment. However, there are some fundamental factors in place that could help increase M&A activity over the long term, including the low concentration levels in certain markets, a rise in capital buffers seen at several insurers already, and interest from emerging markets.

Life witnessed a strong recovery in growth, while Health showed the highest growth rate. From a geographic perspective, the emerging markets of Latin America and Emerging Asia continue to be the highest growth areas. Despite these recent gains, the industry cannot be complacent; there are many uncertainties and challenges ahead for which it needs to prepare and multiple questions to answer. What is the right product strategy for Life insurers, as Solvency 2 approaches, competition increases, and a prolonged low-interest rate environment is becoming a new reality? What will be the speed and magnitude of the introduction of new car technologies and how will this impact the Motor insurance market? What growth strategies are best and what is the potential role of M&A in these?  To answer these questions and maintain a competitive edge, insurers need an in-depth understanding of current and future trends, such as those provided by our GIP analyses, so they can re-examine their product mix, geographic focus, and capabilities. Those companies that identify new developments, prepare for change and adapt to the rapidly evolving landscape may emerge as the winners.

The GIP Markets Database comprises the 64 largest insurance markets, covering more than 99 percent of total global premiums.  The level of detail in our GIP Markets Database varies from market to market. For the less advanced markets, the data might include gross premiums written, technical reserves, and profits. For the more advanced markets, it includes complete sets of financial indicators for each product line, including the mix of distribution channels. Historical data covers the period 2000–2013, with estimates for 2014 based on H1 or Q3 reporting, and our forecasts run until 2020. Historical data are available in local currency as well as in EUR and USD (and other currencies). In the present report, we express the historical data and forecasts in EUR using 2013 fixed exchange rates.  GIP distinguishes five product groups in Life, based on European terminology: Term Life, Endowments, Annuities, Unit-linked, and Group Life (see below for detailed descriptions). P&C includes five product groups: Motor, Fire & Property, Liability, Accident, and Other (such as Travel). Health is considered a separate line and includes all Health premiums underwritten by pure Health insurers and Life or P&C insurers, based on data extracted either from the Life data or P&C records (depending on the regulatory treatment).  The distribution mix is available for the largest 35 countries. The channel categories include tied agents, brokers/IFAs, bancassurance, branches, remote, and other (such as retailers and car dealers).  The GIP model was built on a country-by-country basis by collecting and analyzing public data (such as national insurance regulators’ data and/or industry association publications) and drawing on the insights of our global network of local experts. We mapped the local product types and distribution channels to the standard globally accepted definitions.  In addition to the Markets Database, GIP now also offers integrated data on selected global and local insurers.  The Local Insurers Database includes key financial indicators for the top 15 largest local insurers in 11 individual markets for the years 2005-2013. In addition, the database includes premiums data (for Total, Life and Non-Life) for the top 10 insurance groups in 52 countries for the period 2000-2013.  The Global Insurers Database includes key financial statement information for 105 global insurers including their split for Life and Non-Life for the period 2005-2014.  Life product definitions  Term Life: all types of protection products with purely biometric risk coverage.  Endowments: all individual life-savings products (both single and regular premium) that provide a guaranteed credited-rate component and a lump-sum payout. Under US terminology, this would include Universal Life and Whole Life.  27  Appendix   28  Annuities: individual life-savings products (both single and regular premium) that provide a guaranteed credited-rate component and a payout in the form of an annuity (in other words, regular monthly payment streams either for a fixed duration or for life). Under US terminology, this would include Fixed Annuities.  Unit-linked: individual life-savings products (both single and regular premium) for which the policyholder bears the investment risk and that provide a lump-sum payout. Under US terminology, this would include Variable Life, Variable Universal Life, and Variable Annuities.  Group Life: includes Group Protection, Group Unit-linked, and Group Annuities; the largest segment is Corporate Pensions.  Forecasting methodology  Our volumes-forecasting model is based on a series of historical multivariate regression models that use both macroeconomic drivers and momentum as explanatory variables for premium growth.  We run panel regressions with random effects at both country and product-category levels. For Life, P&C, and Health, we split countries into 2 or 3 subgroups, based primarily on each country’s level of maturity. We then run separate regressions for the subgroups at the country and product-category levels, with particular equation specifications for each product.  The macro-drivers we considered include GDP growth (nominal and real), long-term and short-term interest rates, penetration, and equity market returns.  For our profit-forecasting model we also developed separate methodologies for Life, P&C, and Health.  For P&C and Health, we take a driver-based approach in which we forecast separately all of the components of profit (claims, costs, and investment income). For each profit component, we test various specifications, combining macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation) and time-series variables (such as momentum effects and mean-reversion effects). The approach for Life was similar. That said, since Life profits are highly sensitive to capital market and regulatory conditions, any profit forecast is only valid under the assumption of stability on both these fronts.  For both P&C and Life, we ran panel regressions grouping similar countries. Overall, the regressions have generated superior results, with strong R² values, good stability, and reasonable back-testing behavior.  All our models employ economic forecasts from Oxford Economics. Our global network of local experts reviews the forecasts produced by our regression models to adjust for any specificities in local markets (upcoming regulatory changes, demographic shifts, pension or healthcare system reforms, etc.).   Use of fixed exchange rates to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations  Our analysis generally uses nominal figures based on 2013 fixed exchange rates. This approach allows us to compare local growth rates without the interference of sometimes highly pronounced currency fluctuations. One drawback of our method, however, is that it does not account for differing inflation rates across countries. In consequence, estimates of growth in markets with high inflation (such as some countries in Latin America) may show an upward bias that can significantly distort comparisons among countries over the long term. In some cases, there are striking differences in the results, depending upon what method we use. For instance, an analysis using nominal figures based on fixed exchange rates showed that growth in emerging markets was six times higher than growth in mature markets from 2011 through 2013 (12 percent versus 2 percent). When we used yearly exchange rates, growth in emerging markets was only three times as high (9 percent versus 3 percent).  29   30  Global insurance heat maps 1 At fixed exchange rates 2013  2013–20E CAGR <0% 3-6% 0-3%  Premiums, 2013, EUR billion 6-10%  10-15% >15%  Asia Pacific ex.

Page ii  About this report  With this paper, NATHEALTH and Bain & Company seek to drive thought leadership with the aim of moving towards a healthier, aarogya (disease-free) India over the next decade. This paper aims to build a comprehensive view of India’s current healthcare ecosystem and share perspectives on the future evolution patterns of India’s healthcare.  For a large number of Indians today, access to quality healthcare is inadequate, and the health system’s goals of access, affordability and quality remain elusive. An onslaught of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has resulted in a dual disease burden even as the country continues to struggle to combat communicable diseases (CDs). Focus on prevention and wellness is limited, reflecting a highly unorganised primary-care system and a long-standing curative bias among patients and caregivers. Compounding the situation is an inadequate delivery infrastructure, talent shortage and limited funding from public and private sources.  This paper lays out an aspirational vision for Indian healthcare for the next decade (2015–2025); the overall objective is to ensure access to quality care at an affordable cost for every citizen of India. To achieve this objective, this paper defines the key imperatives for multiple stakeholders, while assessing the gaps and requirements in critical resources and the paradigm shifts that will lead to change.   Aarogya Bharat: India Healthcare Roadmap for 2025 | Bain & Company, Inc.  Page 1  Executive summary  Today, healthcare in India is at a crossroads. As a nation, we have made noteworthy progress across several dimensions, and India is healthier today than ever. We have successfully eradicated multiple diseases, including smallpox, polio and guinea worm disease. HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths have dropped significantly. India has emerged as a hub for generic-drug manufacturing and boasts a large public-health infrastructure.  Despite evolution on multiple fronts, however, India still struggles with substantial issues and gaps in its healthcare system (see Figure 1). Healthcare is under-served and under-consumed. Insurance covers less than a quarter of the population, and out-of-pocket spending is considerably high. India faces a severe shortage of both hard infrastructure and talent, with regional imbalances and variations in healthcare delivery. The strong bias towards curative care reflects a culture in which prevention and wellness receive only limited focus and investments in primary care and public health have long been inadequate. Quality of care is questionable, hindered by limited accreditation and adoption of basic technologies.  Megatrends observed for India will combine with these underlying issues and gaps to make India’s health system further unsustainable:  • Increasing urbanisation has led to an explosion of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and India now carries a dual burden of communicable diseases (CDs) and NCDs.  • India’s population is evolving and ageing, with the geriatric age group expected to constitute 11% share by 2025.  Figure 1: The current state of healthcare in India requires action across multiple dimensions  Economic loss impact from NCDs by 2030  ~$6T  Population affected by tropical diseases  ~315M  Percentage of GDP as public spending on healthcare  1.3%  Cumulative healthcare spending requirement by 2025  ~$3T  Urban diabetes patients who receive adequate treatment, out of ~38M  ~3M  Population with no health insurance  ~75%  Maternal mortality rate vs. MDG target of 109  178  Gap in bed capacity  ~2M  Percentage of delivery providers accredited  <1%  Notes: WHO is the World Health Organization; MDG is Millennium Development Goal; NCDs is non-communicable diseases Sources: Euromonitor; World Bank; Bain analysis   Aarogya Bharat: India Healthcare Roadmap for 2025 | Bain & Company, Inc.  Page 2  • Sustained cost pressures are limiting affordability in the largely uninsured environment, even as a rising mass market is demanding greater access to quality care.  • Particularly disturbing is the allocation of public healthcare spending, which is among the lowest in the world and has stagnated in the last few decades.  Now is an opportune time to define India’s health system in order to power India’s growth and development. Healthcare consumption is expected to increase progressively in the future, in line with economic growth. The emergence of disruptive technologies is likely to aid care delivery and lead to consumers who are more informed, engaged, discerning and value conscious (see Figure 2). Significant growth and refinement of health infra-structure are anticipated: Investments by financial investors (PE/VCs) in healthcare have surged recently, the government has announced a sharp focus on transforming India’s health system and an emerging paradigm emphasises access to quality healthcare as a basic human right. Investment in healthcare will create a virtuous cycle of productivity, employment and consumption, resulting in overall economic growth (see Figure 3).  Today, all stakeholders have an exciting opportunity to transform India’s health system in several ways:  • Creating a healthy India to power the country’s development and growth and minimising disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost to preventable sickness.  • Seizing the potential for significant job creation from healthcare services (15 million to 20 million additional jobs by 2025).  Figure 2: The consumer mindset is changing  Source: Bain analysis  The future healthcare consumer in India will be…   Better informed on health risks and mitigating factors   Better educated on importance of healthy living   Able to differentiate products and services on quality and outcomes   Exposed to more influencers (e.g. payers, doctors, user communities, social media)   Assuming greater responsibility for one’s own health outcomes   More tech savvy and willing to adopt new technology (e.g. wearables)   An increasingly vocal and influential participant in the delivery value chain   Demonstrating strong advocacy behaviour for quality services   Offered a greater choice of healthcare providers (increased competition)   Under insurance coverage (public or private) with greater overall consumption   More value conscious due to individual responsibility (higher co-pays, deductions)   Seeking total health and integrated health solutions  Aware and informed  Engaged and participative  Discerning and value conscious   Aarogya Bharat: India Healthcare Roadmap for 2025 | Bain & Company, Inc.  Page 3  • Helping India move beyond the manufacture of generic drugs to emerge as an innovation hub in lower-cost health products and services and decrease dependence on costly imports.  • Providing health insurance to the masses, with a commensurate decline in out-of-pocket spending, thereby preventing people from falling into poverty due to healthcare spending.  • Reducing the urban-rural divide in the supply and consumption of healthcare.  • Adopting greater use of technology to create scalable and more sustainable made-for-India solutions and to increase health awareness and engagement.  • Turning India into an exporter of new paradigms in affordable quality care among emerging economies.  India must choose its evolutionary trajectory wisely. Clear choices must be made regarding the role that government will play and how it will prioritise and fund healthcare. We need to reshape the paradigm of care in India and create a culture of health and wellness. To undertake this journey, we will need to redefine the health system and clearly lay out the preferred path on three key dimensions of health delivery: Access, Cost and Quality. Making the right choices in areas such as role of government, regulations on essential healthcare goods and services, innovation in payment models, use of technology and sources of funding will be critical in defining the future trajectory of Indian healthcare (see Figure 4).  India has a narrow window of opportunity in which it must act quickly. If we can succeed in capitalising on the immense opportunity, we can aspire to achieve a massive shift in healthcare within a decade (see Figure 5).

Page 5  We can aim for equitable access to affordable healthcare, along with minimum quality standards for highly aware and engaged consumers, by 2025. This sustainable healthcare ecosystem would be centred on a wellness-oriented culture focussing on prevention and early diagnosis.  Key recommendations  Several steps are necessary to ensure that the transformation of India’s health system is a success, and multiple stakeholders need to collaborate to develop a holistic and sustainable healthcare system, with central and state governments playing pivotal roles.  Immediate priorities  • Ensure that the government assigns national priority to the healthcare agenda, commits to spending more on public health and defines a holistic framework for an India-centric health system. The government must also set clear health priorities, clarify roles and establish enabling incentives and regulations for stakeholders.  • Enable a paradigm shift to healthy living, with a focus on prevention and primary care through greater public spending on prevention, individual incentives for healthy living and broader engagement of multiple stake-holders (for example, technology and food and beverage companies, media, schools and others).  • Scale up and expand current programmes to control NCDs—such as mental illness, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer—with care offerings that integrate screening, prevention, treatment and follow-up, enabled by partnerships—both private-private and public-private, and across the delivery, insurance, technology and pharmaceutical sectors of the healthcare industry.  • Drive insurance adoption and reduce out-of-pocket expenses by rolling out a universal healthcare-coverage scheme for essential care. Provide government support for disadvantaged populations, such as the elderly and low-income deciles.  • Institutionalise standards for the minimum quality of delivery across products and services, and initiate tracking of outcomes. Use health-technology-assessment (HTA) tools to determine access to innovation.  • Use technology and IT in healthcare to overcome access barriers in remote areas and engage patients. Focus investments on India-specific solutions.  • Expand the supply of healthcare talent in critical roles, rejuvenate AYUSH (ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homeopathy) and encourage private investment in education. Improve the talent quality using a clear roadmap for governance and continuing medical education (CME) for professionals.  • Give an impetus to local manufacturing. Transform India into an export hub for medical products and equipment and into an R&D hub for tropical diseases.  Short-term priorities  • Create enabling regulations to foster private enterprise in healthcare, at sustainable returns (see Figure 6).  • Inculcate a culture of personal responsibility for health through education, awareness, schooling, public mandates and incentives—for example, through health savings accounts and co-payments.   Aarogya Bharat: India Healthcare Roadmap for 2025 | Bain & Company, Inc.  Page 6  • Encourage the build-out of healthcare infrastructure beyond the metropolitan areas and in under-served areas.  • Focus on preventive capabilities and public health measures to meet post-2015 Millennium Development Goals (or Sustainable Development Goals) for maternal and child health outcomes, with a special focus on reducing the dual burden of CDs and NCDs.  Medium-term priorities  • Build capacity in both the health system and the community to provide long-term care, especially for the indigent and elderly, and mental healthcare to those who need it.  • Encourage innovation in care models. Shift from hospital-centred delivery and procedure-centred, fee-for-service models towards low-cost delivery, capitation-based payments and population health models.  • Encourage greater self-regulation and ethical behaviour among medical professionals, enabled through oversight from professional councils (see Figure 7).  What we ask of the government  The central government has shown encouraging signs that it intends to make healthcare a national priority and to take transformational steps in this sector. We ask the government to take the lead in bringing about key changes to enable the shift in India’s healthcare system over the next decade:  Figure 6: A shift in regulatory framework across several key dimensions is needed  Private funding in healthcare   Lack of clarity on infrastructure status (tax benefits, bank lending) for capital investment in healthcare  Limited participation of private sector in medical education  Current status Shift required   Finalise modalities under infrastructure status  Encourage private sector participation in medical education through incentives, PPPs  Allow real estate investment trusts in healthcare  Domestic manufacturing (medical devices, drugs)   High import duties on raw materials for medical devices  Inconsistent, restrictive price controls on devices and drugs  Delayed and limited approvals for clinical trials   Facilitate “make in India” innovation through lower excise duties and reduced import duties  Encourage innovative medicine through appropriate pricing and enhanced transparency in approval process for clinical trials  Quality of care   Limited adoption of accreditation  Lack of regulatory framework for clinical care standards  Limited accountability and coordination across points of care  Mandate minimum quality standards of delivery   across products and services  Define and institutionalise guidelines and protocols for more standardised care  Encourage IT adoption across the healthcare ecosystem to enable integrated care  License renewal requirements   Low implementation of limited requirement for continuing medical education (CME)   Mandate implementation of existing CME standards for licence renewal  Redefine and expand CME roadmap  Note: PPP is public-private partnership Source: Bain analysis   Aarogya Bharat: India Healthcare Roadmap for 2025 | Bain & Company, Inc.  Page 7  • Increase public spending on healthcare from 1.3% in 2012 to 3% of GDP by 2025.  • Apportion a greater share of public spending on prevention, including mass screenings, and on primary care coverage.  • Pilot and scale up universal-coverage models to guarantee essential care.  • Drive policy consensus among the central and state governments to ensure that high priority is given to health and uniformity in health regulations.  • Define a vision and roadmap for NCDs and healthy living, roll out high-impact public-health interventions and ensure multistakeholder engagement.  • Mandate that delivery and diagnostic providers and device manufacturers meet minimum quality standards.  • Invest in an IT backbone and interoperability standards in healthcare, and provide incentives for adoption.  • Build competency in HTAs, and implement them to manage access to innovation in publicly funded products and services.  • Create an enabling ecosystem that provides incentives for private investment in delivery infrastructure, medical education, R&D and domestic manufacturing.  Figure 7: It is critical to address ethical considerations in Indian healthcare  Source: Bain analysis  Issue  !  !  !  !  Root cause  Overuse of medical procedures, diagnostic tests; lack of appropriate care  Preferential prescription and promotion of specific brands of drugs and devices  Ambiguity in pricing for private healthcare products and services  Inconsistent quality of healthcare  Misaligned incentives (fee-for-service, quantity vs. quality focus)  “Kickbacks” and referral fees  Lack of transparency and full disclosure by service providers and product suppliers  Lack of protocols and standards for care; limited accreditations  Need self-regulation and multistakeholder engagement to ensure transparency and ethical practices   Aarogya Bharat: India Healthcare Roadmap for 2025 | Bain & Company, Inc.  Page 8  • Establish systems to rationally determine the pricing of publicly funded products and services; for example, procedures through Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), India’s national health programme.  • Adopt a mission approach for India-focussed drug R&D, for example, for tropical diseases, and for public health initiatives such as vaccination coverage.  Commitment from NATHEALTH members  We recognise that there is a significant deficit of trust between the private and public sectors in healthcare today. Private players in the healthcare industry have a significant role to play in bridging that gap and enabling a healthier future. Members of NATHEALTH should aspire to the following:  • Invest in expanding the supply of affordable care, especially beyond metropolitan cities and in rural areas, with the right incentives.  • Continue innovation with new delivery models, including in government partnerships, to improve quality of care.  • Invest in frugal innovation in drugs and device manufacturing to transform India into an Asian hub for high-value products.  • Harness technology to expand the reach of existing services such as telemedicine.  • Prioritise investments in the right technology tools, such as electronic health records (EHRs), to enhance care quality and coordination.  • Encourage the adoption of minimum quality standards to improve delivery.  • Invest in enhancing the skills and capabilities of doctors, nurses and allied health personnel through training, career progression and CME.  • Engage with the government on health policy, and share expertise on, for example, procedure costs, pricing and new technology assessments.  • Commit to adopting and promoting ethical behaviours and norms.  • Focus on education and general awareness of healthy living and prevention; invest in worksite wellness programmes for employees.  • Invest a proportion of profits in corporate social responsibility activities, and support social enterprises and causes for a better India.  Must-haves in the health system to achieve the aspirations  As India’s health system transitions towards the aspirational state, multiple underlying factors must be in place:  • Availability of public funds, across the central and state governments, with a greater share of Capex than exists now.   Aarogya Bharat: India Healthcare Roadmap for 2025 | Bain & Company, Inc.  Page 9  • Adequate investments in the private sector, especially incentives to invest in local manufacturing and healthcare delivery in under-served areas.  • Rational pricing for publicly funded services, ensuring fair returns for private providers.  • Supply-side infrastructure readiness to meet anticipated growth in demand, especially following universal coverage.  • Availability of trained talent across geography tiers and among doctors, nurses and allied health professionals.  • High levels of health awareness and individual ownership of health outcomes.  • Health IT and data serving as the backbone for effective implementation of initiatives, tracking outcomes and providing disease surveillance.  • Improved cooperation between the central and state governments for consistent implementation of public initiatives.  A few signposts need to be monitored periodically to measure success and judge whether the transformation of India’s healthcare system is on course (see Figure 8).  Figure 8: How do we measure success and on-track performance?  Input Output Activity   Public spending as a percentage of health- care expenditure   Share of total healthcare (and public) spending on public health, prevention, screening and diagnostics, primary care   Percentage of population with health insurance (public/private/social)   Enrollment of citizens to national health register (Aadhaar)   Life expectancy (at birth, at five years, overall)   Sustainable Development Goals* post–2015   Bed density, distribution across rural and urban areas   Out-of-pocket spending as percent of total spending   Healthcare professionals per 1,000 people   Penetration of technology (e.g. x-ray equipment)   Basic health awareness   Overall coverage of preventive measures – DTP3 immunisation – Percentage of population screened for NCDs   Utilisation of healthcare services in the past year – Primary visits and preventive health checkup – Utilisation by different income classes   Percentage of accredited delivery and diagnostic centres   Progress in India-focused R&D (e.g. drugs for tropical diseases)  *Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) comprise 17 goals for United Nations development agenda beyond 2015; health-related goals include ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all ages, and availability and management of water and sanitation for all Notes: NCDs is non-communicable diseases; BPL is below poverty line; DTP3 immunisation coverage is the percentage of one-year-olds who have received three doses of combined DPT vaccine Source: Bain analysis    India has made progress across several healthcare dimensions  • Life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality rates have improved considerably .  • Multiple diseases, including smallpox, have been successfully eradicated, and the number of HIV infections has been reduced .  Significant gaps exist in the current system  • Healthcare continues to be limited by infrastructure short-comings and lack of an organised delivery system .  • Low spending on healthcare coexists with disproportionately high out-of-pocket spending, given that less than 25% of the population is covered by health insurance .  • Regional distribution of infrastructure and human resources is imbalanced . Although rural India accounts for about 70% of the population, it has less than one-third of the nation’s hospitals, doctors and beds, resulting in large disparities in health outcomes across states .  • Healthcare in India is biased towards curative care, with a significant drop-off in number of patients along the treatment cycle, due to under-diagnosis and inappropriate care .  Current megatrends will render the existing healthcare system unsustainable  • At 1 .3% of GDP, public spending on healthcare in India is among the lowest in both developed and developing nations .  • The rapid rise in NCDs and the slow decline in the prevalence of CDs have resulted in a dual disease burden .  • Changing demographics that yield a higher proportion of geriatric individuals in the overall population—11% in 2025—will increase the burden on supply-side infrastructure .  • A growing mass market will lead to a corresponding increase in the demand for healthcare .  Several indicators hint at the strong growth of healthcare spending in the coming decade  • Healthcare consumption correlates strongly with economic growth and is expected to increase significantly over the next decade .  • Healthcare has attracted large private equity and venture capital investments in recent years and is expected to remain a priority sector for investment .  • Healthcare is a priority for the central government and for some state governments .  • Disruptive technologies have the potential to significantly increase access and affordability over the next decade .  2.

Page 19    Aspiration for universal insurance with government primarily focussing on its role as payer  • India should aspire to universal insurance coverage for essential care with low out-of-pocket spending . The govern-ment should focus on its role as a payer and regulator and drive provision of healthcare in under-served areas, across the care continuum . In addition, the government should take the lead in facilitating public health through a focus on awareness, education, sanitation, immunisation and implementation of public health initiatives . The private sector should lead the provision of care and enable expansion of insurance coverage to urban India .  Improved access and affordability with higher public spending on healthcare  • Total spending on healthcare is anticipated to reach about 6% of GDP by 2025, with out-of-pocket spending at less than 30% . Public spending on healthcare should increase to 3% of GDP and account for ~50% of overall health expenditure, driven by greater government prioritisation of healthcare .  • Private insurance is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of about 25% to cover the top 25% (by income) of the population . Public insurance will provide essential care to 60% of the population .  • Capex spending is likely to grow from less than 10% of overall healthcare spending to 15% . Expanding infrastructure will lead to 1 .8 million additional functional beds, improving the density of beds from 0 .9 per thousand today to 2 .0 per thousand in 2025 .  Shifts in the market aligned with priorities for healthcare  • Outpatient spending is likely to increase, as we see a shift in focus towards primary and preventive care and increased prevalence of home care .  • The share of rural spending will rise with increased afford-ability and disproportionate public spending in rural areas .  • Share of spending on NCDs is expected to reach 60% of expenditures, an increase that reflects lifestyle changes that increase the burden of NCDs, a declining spend on CDs as the burden falls and a demographic shift towards an ageing population .  • As the government rolls out basic insurance for the lower- income deciles in population, access to healthcare will become more equitable and consumption of healthcare services will increase significantly, especially at the bottom of the pyramid .  3.

India must take lessons from these systems into account but adopt an India-centric health system that is capable of powering economic development in India .  Clear choices exist to optimise access, cost and quality  • India should adopt universal access to essential healthcare for all, with provision being led by the private sector, and the government shifting towards a payer and regulator role, with provision support focussed on under-served areas/segments .  • As access expands, India should proactively manage the risk of healthcare cost inflation and ensure affordability for a defined basket of essential services . To accomplish this, the health system should focus on: 1) encouraging healthy living practices; 2) shifting payment models away from the fee-for-service model; 3) instituting reasonable pricing norms on essential goods and services; 4) applying HTA tools to determine access to innovation; and 5) limiting costly imports through focus on frugal innovation and “Make in India .”  • Minimum assured quality standards need to be defined and institutionalised, with the following priorities: 1) ensuring regular data capture at points of care, and tracking and measurement of outcomes; 2) achieving greater accreditation of facilities; 3) moving towards protocol-based care; and 4) instituting effective governance to ensure compliance in the fragmented Indian delivery landscape .  4.

Declare war on NCDs!  • It is estimated that NCDs will cost India $6 trillion by 2030 .  • Population-level NCD screening efforts are required among high-risk groups, followed by enrolment of diagnosed pop-ulations in holistic care plans, including education and counselling on healthy living .  Prioritise and perform key actions to facilitate the paradigm shift  • A public health focus on clean water and sanitation, large- scale immunisation programmes for prevention and increased awareness on the part of individuals are needed to reduce risk factors .  • Making trained talent available at the grassroots level will enable multidisciplinary primary care .  • Creating a technology and health IT backbone that enables data integration and continuous customer engagement will also lead to coordinated care across different points of delivery .  • A payer shift towards prevention is needed, with outpatient services covered by insurance and with rewards for behaviours that prioritise prevention and wellness .  5.

Structural shifts towards specialised, protocol-based and integrated care are needed  • Continuing the trend towards specialisation will improve patient outcomes and lead to greater differentiation among service providers .  • Moving towards protocol-based care will improve the quality of care, and care integration will help manage costs and improve overall outcomes .  India needs to define and ensure minimum standards of care quality  • Capture and share hospital data to ensure tracking of relevant performance metrics (process, outcomes, safety) .  • Define minimum quality standards and increase adoption by promoting accreditation of facilities .  • Offer differentiated value in services and demonstrate the same to payers and patient advocacy groups .  Innovation will enable low-cost solutions and improved outcomes  • Innovation in delivery formats is needed to ensure that afford-able care can be delivered to the mass market and beyond major cities .  • In partnership-based business models, innovation should increase access and enable integrated patient care across episodes and with better outcomes .  Value-based delivery is needed to address low affordability in India  • A new approach is required that leverages population health principles—such as primary care focus, care coordination, and aligned incentives for caregivers and individuals—and moves away from fee-for-service–based payment models .  Out-of-hospital care solutions are required to improve access and affordability  • Shifting delivery away from hospital-centred care to, for example, home care, rehab and ambulatory care would help reduce costs and improve access .  6.

Page 59    Significant job creation is anticipated in the sector given the large current deficit  • Currently, there is a shortfall of nearly 2 million doctors and 4 million nurses; the talent that is available is highly skewed towards a few states and urban areas .  • Healthcare services are expected to generate demand for 15 million to 20 million new jobs for doctors, nurses and allied health professionals by 2025 .  Increasing the supply of healthcare professionals is a priority  • Prioritising areas with critical shortages of healthcare pro-fessionals (doctors, nurses, allied health) and public health workers (ASHA, Anganwadi, trained birth attendants) will be important . Developing a plan to expand supply will address the skewed geographical distribution in medical education seats .  • Regulations that enable private participation in medical education need to be created . Exploring public-private partnership (PPP) models to enable a rapid increase in medical education seats is a priority .  • Rejuvenating AYUSH care should help supplement primary care . The shortage of doctors should further be addressed through streamlined integration of overseas MBBS graduates .  • Technology should be harnessed to scale and accelerate the development of skills at lower costs, for example, through online continuing medical education (CME), virtual training and distance learning .  The existing doctor population can be scaled to an extent by reducing demand  • Focussing on primary care can help reduce hospitalisation rates . Augmenting specialist nurses and allied health roles can decrease the burden on doctors . And telemedicine and remote monitoring tools can be used to widen the reach of existing doctors and increase their productivity .  Better governance is required to improve the quality of healthcare personnel  • Uniform governance standards in teaching, training and licensing of professionals must be applied . Mandatory accredi-tation of teaching institutes is necessary for better quality .  • Implementing existing licence renewal requirements and developing a roadmap for CME should be priorities .  • Developing and rolling out protocols in primary care and en-couraging group practices will lead to more standardised care .  7.

Page 71    Priorities in health technology need to be identified for India  • India’s unique needs should drive priorities for healthcare technologies: increasing affordability through low-cost products and services, overcoming access barriers and engaging patients through digital health, improving care coordination through IT and addressing tropical diseases through India-focussed R&D .  • Prioritised technologies should be piloted in select care areas, such as mother and child health, NCDs and CDs, before they are rolled out on a full scale .  Government has a key role to play in the judicious adoption of new technology  • Creating a supportive ecosystem for medical device inno-vation can help promote domestic manufacturing in India . Key gaps to address include high import duties on raw materials for medical devices, complex tax restrictions on setting up manufacturing centres and a limited talent pool with medical device expertise .  • Implementing HTAs can help determine access to cost- effective solutions .  • Investments and incentives are needed to set up an IT back-bone and help define interoperability standards .  • Encouraging PPPs for medical education can help augment the workforce skills needed to more quickly adopt technology .  The private sector shares the responsibility to optimise technology in healthcare  • Investing in R&D for prioritised technologies (e .g . telemedicine) should enable equitable access to healthcare .  • Collaborating to build IT-enabled EHRs and patient databases should improve integrated care and population health .  • Concentrating on regional initiatives using mobile and Internet strategies—such as telemedicine, doctors on call and remote patient monitoring—can help improve access to healthcare .  • Using wearable and mobile technology can help educate and engage consumers on healthy living and prevention .  8.

In addition, public Capex has been less than 10% of overall spending .  • Key priorities that need to be funded over the next decade include expanding infrastructure in delivery and medical education, moving towards universal health insurance and augmenting public health services .  Government has to play a key role in enabling greater funding from all sources  • Public spending: The government must assign higher priority to healthcare in budgetary allocations and explore new avenues for fundraising, such as health levies and “sin taxes .” In addition, the government should establish an indepen-dent and empowered body to ensure greater coordination of healthcare spending for interstate and interministerial implementation .  • Private spending: Enable greater private investment by ex-tending tax benefits on Capex for all hospitals, facilitating bank loans beyond seven years, reducing import duties on raw materials for medical devices, allowing real estate invest-ment trusts (REITs) in healthcare and ensuring transparent pricing formulas and clinical trial approvals . PPPs will play a key role in encouraging private investment in delivery, medical education and R&D .  • Private insurance: Provide incentives for payers by facili-tating financing options—for example, provide clarity on foreign direct investment ruling and tax exemptions, and permit debt financing . Increasing tax exemptions on premiums and creating mass awareness can be incentives for consumers to adopt insurance . Beyond this, shifting away from fee-for-service reimbursement models will facilitate faster adoption of health insurance .  • Individual contribution: Optimise significantly high out-of-pocket spending through co-payments and dedicated deductions, resulting in individual accountability for healthcare .  9.

Page 91  Afterword  A clear design framework from the government is required to execute and implement all the recommendations discussed in this paper in a transparent manner.  Current governance mechanisms will be inadequate to manage the rapidly growing operations in healthcare and structural shifts needed to oversee public spending. Central government needs to appoint dedicated bodies to coordinate healthcare across centres and states and to better synchronise different ministries with health-related roles.  Universal health coverage is a long-term objective, but the urgent need is to create a roadmap for implementation, establish checkpoints and assign responsibilities among stakeholders. Also, the government needs to clarify its position on unifying existing public and social insurance schemes as India moves towards universal health coverage.  Regulatory ambiguity will significantly impede the ability to achieve some of the aspirations laid out in this report. The government will need to take the lead in clarifying healthcare regulations for contracts among public and private players, for the management of health technology assessments (HTAs), for price controls on essential healthcare services and so on.  Through NATHEALTH, private-sector participants will seek ways to collaborate with the government to provide expertise and support, and thereby start moving towards a desirable future for Indian healthcare.

Given the investment outlook as described in our report, investors will need to exercise patience and then have the requisite courage to decisively deploy funds when opportunities present themselves. Most of the structural problems to which we referred last year remain, and investors need to be aware of them. Many of the policy responses of recent years that have supported demand in the global economy could be described as ‘quick fixes’. The eurozone has been one of the regions struggling with structural problems, and the migration issue adds to its complexity. The continued fall in the oil price has complicated investment decisions far and wide. Obviously this has been very important in our region. However, governments have devoted great energy to the challenges. Appropriate fiscal adjustments have begun and will continue, and these countries will emerge stronger and with better-balanced economies. The fall in the oil price has been described as a ‘New Normal’, and is in reality another of those significant shifts in the global  investment landscape that we all have to deal with. Another aspect of the ‘New Normal’ is that the European Central Bank (ECB) recently signaled that the quantitative easing introduced last March may get a boost on its first anniversary, and the Bank of Japan has eased policy again, too, by moving to the use of negative interest rates. With the US Federal Reserve tightening last December, and the People’s Bank of China adjusting both monetary and foreign exchange policy, 2016 will be another year when investors will need to pay close attention to major central banks’ policies. The risks associated with a strong dollar are amongst those uppermost in our minds, especially insofar as this could exacerbate the reduction in US corporate earnings. Regarding potential opportunities that lie ahead, there are many emerging and frontier markets that are already very depressed - both equities and bonds. Some of these could well begin to stabilize (or even recover) later this year. Many of those markets are driven by commodities, and we do expect to see some exceptional investment opportunities in commodity-related assets in 2016. In this Outlook, besides a range of views on the markets, we have included some articles on asset allocation and investing rules that we hope you will find illuminating and enjoyable. Most of all, with this - and our regular publications throughout the year - we at NBAD Global Asset Management sincerely hope you will navigate the markets profitably in the rest of 2016.

Probably Japan; negative rates don’t cancel debt • The other known Black Swan is increasing illiquidity, driven by more regulations • Fewer market makers, lower capacity - all this means even more volatile markets, everywhere • Although the US credit cycle has turned, US Treasuries will likely see yields fall - maybe steeply • Reduced growth and too much debt equals sustained low yields on quality government bonds • Buyers of shorter-dated eurozone or Japanese governments will face higher negative yields • High Yield spreads moving out have historically been lead indicators of equity downside • Of the risks we see, the most ‘expected’ is a bear market in US stocks (reassess at election time?)  Developed Equity Markets • 1945-2009 saw 11 US expansions (lasting an average of 59 months), vs. 79 months now • Recessions have lasted an average of ten months; all the earnings ‘tricks’ have been exhausted • Rallies in the S&P500 provide a pre-recession selling opportunity in this over-valued asset class • It is too early to try to quantify S&P500 downside, as estimate revisions haven’t yet slowed • Developed market equity assets are highly correlated - and this increases during market stress • Eurozone equities should outperform the US by 5-10% (due to low P/Es), but are correlated to the S&P500 • In Japanese equities, corporate re-structuring is a positive, but these are also correlated to the US  Emerging Market & Frontier Equities • In major Emerging Market (EM) equities, the estimated earnings growth rates all look too high • EM earnings should stabilize this year; shortlist: Korea, Argentina, India & Russia (very low P/E) • In Chinese equities, we have zero trust in the estimates; ‘blocked sales’ stock must come out • Our article, ‘India Revisited’, takes a measured view of the country’s investment prospects  Oil • Oil is range-bound ($25-45), capped by forward sales and ‘OPEC’/US shale production • Longs can be established close to $25, for 60% upside to $40; ‘stop’ at $20 (3:1), i.e. 20% • Oil’s lower range is defined by stocks rising from 27.9 days consumption at end 2013, to 32.6 now • Short oil positions approximate 9 days’ consumption; short-covering can drive 8-12% up-moves  Mena Economics, Equities & Bonds • Closer to home, we have discussed the economic outlook for most of the MENA countries • The ‘new normal’ in oil has provoked reforms and fiscal effectiveness by GCC oil producers • The UAE and emirates’ governments had already been tightening fiscally before oil prices fell • Existing MENA currency pegs should remain for the time being; later, more ‘baskets’ are likely • In MENA equities markets, we now believe a few of these are very bombed-out e.g. the UAE • The article on Egypt reaches positive conclusions, provided currency issues are fixed • Turning to MENA bonds, if oil prices have stopped plummeting, this is a cheap asset class  G3 Forex • In forex, we have been looking for signs of the end of the dollar bull market, but it’s still aloft • We expect a new and especially serious round of competitive currency devaluations and • Unless the Fed also goes to negative deposit rates, the dollar will strengthen, thus ‘lose’ the war • In ‘A View from the Trading Room’, our colleagues are backing an outsider to do well: sterling! • Unless the Fed is prepared to consider negative rates, they will ‘lose’ the next currency war  Investment Approach • Having above-average cash is advisable for the moment, and being overweight in quality bonds • We have only just begun to see meaningful money coming out of equities; there is no panic yet • It was very difficult to make money in 2015; this year will be worse, and more volatile than last • Gold is an excellent place to hide, and we are bullish; an article on this will be published soon • Sovereign wealth funds are only retaining their very best external managers; their sales continue • Investors no longer assume much growth; they are hunting the few PMs who generate genuine alpha • 2016 should see excellent, nimble ‘active’ managers’ win; performance dispersion helps them • Where mandates allow, excellent ‘market-neutral’ funds will be a good place to be • Sometime in the months to come there are likely to be genuine ‘just get me out’ sales • Right now it’s best for most investors to be doing nothing; only trade if you’re a good trader! • Having said this, we do expect to recommend putting money to work - just not yet! • Start the homework - invest where FDI flows will likely go when China sentiment bottoms • Much of our research is directed to successfully identifying the best commodities, and • For instance we are looking for great weather forecasters who have an edge in trading ‘softs’ • In metals and other materials, the ‘supply-side’ response has begun, even if demand is weak • When the commodity shorts cover it will mean a classic trading opportunity in all related assets • The article, ‘Asset Allocation: What it should mean for private investors goes well with... • ‘Simple Rules of Investing 2.0’ - a sequel to last year’s article • Lastly, ‘How to Invest in Gold’ attempts to cover the basics   ReVIew Of OUR 2015 TheMeS ReVIew Of OUR 2015 TheMeS  NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  4 5  REVIEw of oUR 2015 ThEMES Broadly we were right in our advice for investors to invest with limited risk, that they would be ‘Seeking Returns in a Fragile World’, and should be focused on sound income generation and sectors and countries with inherent growth. Last year was not a year when taking risk paid off, unless one was very nimble indeed. Markets were choppy, with risk assets generally under pressure.  Buying growth 2015 proved to be yet another disappointing year for global GDP growth. The latest IMF estimate for last year is 3.1%, although we expect this to be revised downwards, despite very low interest rates and waves of quantitative easing. Our two choice sectors, Healthcare and Technology, generated moderate returns at 4.9% and 1.9% respectively, compared to MSCI World at -2.7%. The MSCI All Country Healthcare index had outperformed global equities by over 10% for the year-to-date until Hilary Clinton suggested pricing caps, with the sector subsequently giving back about half of that outperformance. The global technology sector has outperformed with more consistency overall, although with a wide range of winners and losers. Google, for instance, rose by 45%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 5.7%, driven by the so-called ‘Fangs’ (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google), and the ‘Nifty Nine’, which also includes Priceline, eBay, Starbucks, Microsoft and Salesforce.  Emerging and Frontier equity markets We were right to highlight that country selection would be especially important in the emerging markets. We began the year with a preference for China and India, but downgraded China aggressively when the  Technology sector outperformed over 2015  Leading EM equity markets a very mixed bag during 2015  Frontier markets succumb to weakness of commodity markets  GCC equity markets under pressure  Source: Bloomberg  Source: Bloomberg  Source: Bloomberg  Source: Bloomberg Source: Bloomberg  Healthcare sector outperformed over 2015  market hit dizzying heights in the first quarter. Chinese retail investors using often considerable leverage exacerbated the sharp rise and fall in Chinese equities. Russian equities were a missed opportunity as they rallied sharply later in the year to close only 4.3% lower over 2015. It must be said that some opportunities in the emerging markets come with simply too much risk.  At times our preference for Frontier markets worked well, however, the persistent weakness of commodities eventually weighed heavily on them, causing marked underperformance against Emerging markets in the latter months of the year.  Caution on MENA equities Our caution on the outlook for MENA equity markets was vindicated. Oil prices remained at low levels for much of the year. Government finances were materially impacted leading to lower government spending, reduced bank lending, and weakening GDP growth. Regional equity markets performed poorly, with Egypt and Saudi Arabia respectively 21.5% and 17.8% lower over the year. MENA bonds by contrast were relatively flat over the year; we said at the start of the year that regional bond markets looked fully valued, but were likely to be well supported due to the likelihood of limited new supply and on the whole sound balance sheets.

Indian equities did well very early in the year, but the Sensex index closed down 6.2% over the year. Government 10-year bonds generated a total return of 7.0% in 2015. Lower-than-expected inflation and a lower current account deficit provided scope for the central bank to cut interest rates. Whilst the new government led by Narendra Modi promised much, policy delivery has been difficult in practice. Lacking a majority in the upper house the government has been unable to deliver the structural changes that the markets crave. Prime Minister Modi has brought a great deal of focus on India, however this will have been wasted effort if structural changes needed to solidify incoming foreign direct investment are not forthcoming.  Infrastructure Our view that much needs to be spent globally on infrastructure still holds, although in 2015 there was only modest investment spending in the sector. In the developed world central banks are still the policy makers taking centre stage in trying to generate growth. In the US, Presidential candidate Hilary Clinton in a recent speech extolled the virtues of infrastructure spending; indeed it may become a common feature of a number of the Presidential candidates’ policy agendas for later this year. Also, in the emerging world there are new infrastructure initiatives; China’s new transnational infrastructure policy (the ‘One belt, One Road’ strategy) has been underpinned by China’s creation of the $100 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Henry To, writing in Forbes, estimated that the strategy would add about $100 billion per annum in infrastructure financing/spending across central Asian countries from this year onwards.  Protecting your wealth We were proven correct that investors needed to concentrate as much on risk management as on chasing returns in 2015. Indeed chasing returns proved to be an often fruitless pursuit. Equity markets (in terms of the MSCI World index) closed 2.7% lower over the year. The well-weather S&P500 was down  Gold Many will consider that gold didn’t provide the protection to portfolios that would have been hoped for. Gold ended the year just over 10% down. However during times of market stress in 2015, gold was at times the best performing asset. For instance when there was extreme disappointment with first quarter growth, gold touched $1,300. When there was a mini meltdown of markets in the third quarter as the Fed prevaricated, gold held up very well.  Investing for income versus capital gain 2015 was a mixed year for income investing. The persistent fear of higher interest rates put many high income-generating equities on the back foot. However, with positive equity returns hard to come by a good dividend stream helped to mitigate some of the pain of losses. In fixed income markets, more active investors had to trade around the market sentiment of when the Fed might raise rates. US High Yield and Investment Grade indices didn’t provide positive returns (-3.5% and -0.8% respectively), while the US 7-10 year governments index generated a 1.7% return. Bond markets generally fully discounted the December Fed rate hike beforehand.  Risks The markets had to contend with a multitude of risks in 2015. No single event completely derailed the global economy, however there were many challenges. The biggest difficulty was perhaps trying to distinguish between what could be considered one-offs, versus factors that are likely to persist. Of the risks we saw on the horizon, a number have yet to come to pass although they remain. The eurozone may have ‘papered over’ the Greek problems, but investors are in no way convinced that sustainable solutions have been found. As we suggest elsewhere in this book, the Fed probably waited far too long to raise rates - and has now begun to do so ‘Just in time for the down-cycle’ (see Weekly Investment View, 21st December, 2015).  0.7%. Investors were faced with continuing speculation regarding if and when the US Federal Reserve would finally raise interest rates. The safer fixed income asset classes did a reasonable job of preserving capital during the year, and often with considerably less risk than equity markets.

For example, who at the end of 2014 would have predicted any of the key strategic events of last year, such as Russia’s direct intervention in Ukraine, Europe’s refugee crisis - or Donald Trump being a serious candidate for the White House this November? The US has avoided the kind of turmoil unleashed in Europe, but is currently battling its own internal demons and integration problems, some of which date back a few centuries. There are some battles ahead on all these fronts and various others for 2016. Will the mass of displaced people flooding into Europe begin to be allowed to prove their economic worth? We comment on some of these topics below, finishing with the key financial risks we perceive, such as the growing illiquidity in capital markets. Whilst keeping an eye on the ‘known’ risks, it seems to us that investors should be even more prepared to ‘expect the unexpected’ in 2016.  Europe and its refugee crisis Europe faces the world’s largest refugee crisis since the Second World War, which led to over a million people arriving in Europe by sea alone last year, and it’s hard to see any significant reversal of this situation in 2016. Heightened feelings of economic and personal vulnerability have manifested in drastically increased support for nationalist political groups, fueled by the global economy still wallowing in a slow and shallow post-crisis recovery. With unemployment in Europe at very high levels and little sign of significant improvement anytime soon, the refugee/migrant situation provides an easy target for castigation, with these views likely to gain further traction in the year ahead and leading to growing political unrest.  Having said this, the potential benefits of migration on a manageable scale are beginning to be appreciated. Angela  Merkel’s popularity may have been hit by the acceptance of 800,000 refugees, although from a demographic perspective Germany may have just enhanced its future productivity. As with various Western and other populations life expectancy has increased in the eurozone, while at the same time the next few years will see a reduction of the working age population, resulting in an increased burden on younger generations to support the provision of pensions, welfare and healthcare, and especially with many ‘baby- boomers’ retiring earlier. If Germany can aid social integration with its free language and cultural lessons it may be able to successfully boost its working population. Recent European Commission data suggests that the arrival of the refugees will ultimately have a positive impact on GDP of 0.2-0.5% in affected EU countries. Any benefits are expected to be muted in transit countries such as Greece, Hungary and Slovenia, with the likes of Sweden and Germany benefiting the most from longer-term settlement. Initially this growth stems from short-term government spending to accommodate new residents, however studies have shown that refugees make a net positive contribution to society once they are settled*. In the UK it has been found that new arrivals are less likely than native Britons to be on state benefits or living in social housing. The Migration Observatory at Oxford University has estimated that the UK’s public debt could be halved in 50 years if it allowed entry  to 260,000 immigrants a year. With Prime Minister Cameron bowing to public pressure and vowing to only take 20,000 refugees it doesn’t look likely that the UK will benefit from such a small influx.  In certain respects the focus on the negative aspects of mass migration is not unfair. The pressure on infrastructure in countries like Greece has been tremendous, with 80% of migrants landing there. There are also concerns regarding government expenditures on housing and benefits that detract from help that could otherwise be offered to lower-income families. The issues relating to integration have been further exacerbated by the speed with which this mass movement of people has taken place; over one million people reached Europe alone in 2015. All of these people need shelter, food and language education merely to survive and building a new life will also involve breaking through cultural barriers. With expectations that the number of refugees will increase this year and then decline into 2017 the EU has tried to implement a quota system which has been met with dismay by some countries, and has been opted-out of by others.  In the short run, the impact from mass migration into Europe is likely to result in further political and racial unrest, rather than economic benefits. Europe has already seen the impact of a fractious immigration policy when married with high unemployment rates amongst under 25s, with Spain the perfect  example. The Spanish government is currently in a state of flux and this looks likely to lead to a dissolution of parliament and a general election. Predominantly this stemmed from the popularity of Podemos, a party that runs on an anti-immigration and anti-austerity ticket. Their speedy growth has totally thrown off the more traditional balance of power and a coalition looks highly unlikely. German politics have also come into the forefront with an early exit for Merkel, once unthinkable, being openly discussed.  Brexit The UK’s membership of the EU has returned to the forefront of British politics. The implications of a Brexit are far from clear, although market-wise, expectations appear to be for a repeat of the 2014 Scottish referendum, i.e. ‘close, but no cigar’. Thus we also believe that when push comes to shove, together with some likely scare-mongering by the ‘stay-in’ camp, and with some last-minute concessions from the EU, the majority of UK voters will decide (albeit somewhat reluctantly) to stay in Europe, especially if Mr. Cameron does negotiate some good concessions. A Brexit would probably be quite a disaster for the EU, offering hope to other groups looking to remove themselves from under the thumb of Brussels’ bloated bureaucracy and endemic wastage. On a related general note (and following on from thoughts expressed in last year’s Outlook), we remain deeply skeptical of the underlying basis of the European Union, and especially almost everything about its single currency.  The US Presidential Election Turn on the television or open a newspaper any day of the week and Donald Trump is sure to be mentioned, whether it’s the latest person or group he’s insulted or how well he’s doing in the polls. He has managed to tap into a good number of ordinary Americans’ fears as well as the deep frustration with the mainstream ‘business as usual’ politicians, who have yet to figure out how to combat his unorthodox style. Many respected political pundits wrote Trump off as a serious Republican candidate months ago and have waved the banner for Jeb Bush. These same analysts must have rubbed their eyes in disbelief at the CNN/ORC Republican  *UN’s International Labour Organisation and the OECD, UCL  More than ever, investors need to ‘expect the  unexpected’ in 2016  Expectations for the Brexit result appear to be for a  repeat of the Scottish referendum.   primary elections poll held at the end of 2015, showing Trump at 39%, Cruz at 18%, Rubio at 11.5%, with Bush bringing up the rear at just 4.3%. So while there is still a long road to the White House the chances of Trump taking his party’s nomination cannot be ruled out as fantasy.  Turning to the Democratic camp, Hillary Clinton still leads the field, although she is currently facing a surprisingly robust challenge from her closest rival, Bernie Sanders, who according to political analysts is expected to fade as the primaries progress, especially due to his platform which a number of democrats consider, fairly or unfairly, to be more socialist than centrist. The main risk for Clinton is voter apathy; she doesn’t have the charisma of her husband and has yet to spark real excitement, especially amongst the middle class and minority groups - or amongst women in general, who should be her natural support base. Sanders on the other hand is similar to Trump, as he’s not viewed as just another mainstream politician; as such he could produce some surprise results, creating a much tighter run-off. Ironically, Clinton’s biggest asset is probably Donald Trump, because while he has become a hero to many blue-collar voters, and has achieved sky-high television ratings, he is still an anathema to the majority of Americans. Should he do well in the primaries, this could finally generate sufficient panic to encourage even the most lethargic voter to turn out for the Democrats’ most experienced candidate just to ensure there is no Trump in the White House come November. If however he is knocked out early the field could open up again and consequently a view of the final result could become more uncertain.  The Global Markets’ Background  Economics Global economic growth is rolling over. Major forecasters such as the IMF have revised forecasts downwards. The IMF expects global real GDP growth to be 3.4% in 2016, (vs. 3.1% last year) and 3.6% in 2017, with 2016 growth of 4.3% in emerging & developing economies, and 4.7% next year, vs. 4.0% in 2015. Such forecasts still appear optimistic, and are likely to be revised further downwards.  NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  In the US, only one further 25bps Fed hike is priced in for this year; the domestic economic data is weakening and worries about China persist, which will likely once again be a key reason for the Fed not moving. US financial conditions have tightened due to the strong dollar, falling equity markets, and rising credit spreads already, and the Fed could be moving just as the next down-cycle in the economy is beginning. Could the US and global economy withstand another set of US rate hikes in the months to come? No.  Large falls in emerging market asset prices have produced a ‘reverse-QE’ effect, prompting growing capital outflows. Economic rebalancing and structural reform in China will continue in a steadfast manner, which has room to smooth its transition, via looser monetary and fiscal policy, including more infrastructure spending. We expect the ‘growth recession’ in China to be manageable, as they, too, will do ‘whatever it takes’. Fortunately its much publicized stock markets are relatively small. As part of the overall policy response, further weakness in the renminbi is likely prior to actual SDR entry. Renminbi weakness must be largely out of the way before Chinese equities are ultimately increased in the MSCI and other global equity indices. The real sustainable rate of growth in an economy the size of China, and at its stage of development, is probably in the region of 4-4.5%. The Chinese readjustment has taken a huge toll on emerging markets as an economic group, and as an asset class. We expect the emerging market economies to bottom in late 2016/early 2017, as Chinese growth stabilizes.  Oil is likely to be highly volatile in a $25-45 range on WTI, capped by shale and forward selling. The end of OPEC ‘as we know it’ will see a continuation of revenue maximization via maximum production by major oil producers (refer to the Oil Outlook).  The eurozone will continue in weak recovery mode, helped by bank credit  growth, and in all probability a lower euro. The ECB has announced additional QE is likely; this will only keep growth low, and does not represent salvation. The impact of recent weakness in China and emerging markets on German exports in particular will need to be watched.  Long-term trends in the developed world such as an aging population will continue to restrain global growth, as will total debt growth. The ‘known’ economic ‘Black Swan’ we most worry about is Japan, with its huge government debt, equivalent to greater than 250% of real GDP.  The Changing Structure of Markets Expect more regionalization of markets, as US dollar liquidity flows back to the US in a flight to safety. Investment Grade bonds/prime names will be well supported, but liquidity will shrink further in most classes. Increased financial regulation is continuing to drive market liquidity lower and ongoing deleveraging. Basel III, Dodd Frank, and other national regulators’ initiatives are all making markets more volatile as a result. ‘Shadow banking’ will not be able to fill the funding gap left by reductions in banks’ balance sheets. In developed world banking, focus is switching from the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, to lower leverage. Ongoing banking reforms are forcing a rebalancing away from unsecured, to secured lending. Money market funds will likely continue to move out of cash, into bills and bonds  Interest Rates, Bonds, & Foreign Exchange In credit markets, expect name/sector dispersion to increase as the overall credit curve steepens. The US credit cycle is rolling-over, but US Treasuries will likely see yields fall - maybe steeply. The eurozone credit cycle still has further to go, and we expect 10-year Bund yields to move lower. Inflation will be contained, with almost zero (or negative) rates across the US, eurozone, and Japan at the front-end. The ECB could easily cut rates further, to -0.50bps in 2016, although the Bank of England has indicated  no intention to hike rates. Official G3 rates may be low, but for business (and worse for consumers) actual rates are expensive. In Japan, expect a QE extension (rather than an increase), and more enthusiasm for carry trades; the yen could go to Y130 vs. the dollar.  Equity Markets European unity is now seriously challenged, and the unraveling of the economic union accelerating. Eurozone risk assets might outperform the S&P500 by 5-10%, although are unlikely to avoid a bear market in the US. The S&P500 had a nice run over recent years, but was fueled by QE; this large ‘weight of money’ trade is over. Developed market equity assets are highly correlated; this would only increase in harder times. Market volatility is back (look at the VIX) - this is bearish, so late in the cycle. In developed equities, P/E multiple expansion is over; these will contract with greater earnings uncertainty ahead, as there is little or no room for improved profit margins. Lastly, High Yield (HY) bonds collapsed in 2008; now as then, corporate HY bond spreads are predicting lower equity prices. Are the markets ready for a relatively large correction in the S&P? The most ‘expected’ risk we can see in 2016 is demonstrated in the following chart below.

Of course not all equity markets are highly correlated to the US, although in the developed world they often are. So what should we make of the markets, and where will they go from here? Notwithstanding the falls that have already taken place so far this year, we do remain concerned about developed country equity valuations generally, and the US in particular, and see potential for further falls. The US equity markets have been a key underweight in our asset allocation models. As we go to print, our recommended positioning in eurozone and Japanese equities is overweight, and under review. These last two are very different animals to the US. In the case of eurozone equities, they are much more cheaply rated than the US. In reality, if for instance there is liquidation in US equities, then their major counterparts will also likely fall - but in the case of the eurozone not by as much.  Low and falling oil prices have usually been good for oil-consuming economies and non-oil equities, but this has curiously not appeared to be the case this time around. In the case of the US, earlier last year we saw continued references to the benefits of the ‘gasoline bonus’, but these never seemed to arrive! A study produced last year by VISA suggested that in the US, only 25% of the bonus was actually being spent. Consumers have clearly felt much more comfortable saving most of it, as well as repaying debt  US Further to Janet Yellen’s December defensiveness regarding the possibility of the economic cycle turning (‘expansions don’t die of old age’), we are mindful that according to the US National Bureau of Economic Research, from the trough of the recession of 1945 to the late 2009 recession there have been 11 periods of economic expansion, lasting an average of 59 months. The current expansion cycle began in July, 2009, so if it still exists (we think not) it has lasted some 79 months to date. This is admittedly simplistic, and expansions have been lasting longer in recent decades. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001, on the other hand, was ten months. In market analysis, when we see a forecast P/E that should be heading downwards when common sense suggests it should be heading upwards, we get suspicious. The S&P500 is now down for the year to date (by 6.7%), having had a dreadful start to the year, and is down by 7.1% over 12 months.  US corporations have used every trick in the book to demonstrate apparent growth in earnings. Last year margins were at their highest in a number of years, while share buybacks have perennially been used to ‘grow’ earnings per share. Analysts have also called into question the quality of earnings given the widening gap between reported earnings and officially-recognized ‘GAAP’ earnings. A few months ago, Deutsche Bank research estimated that US corporate margins were 10.75%, a historical record, up from 7% in recent years. The strong dollar has begun to impact US export earnings and also foreign earnings upon translation, and sales growth has been slowing down/turning negative, while interest rates have now moved away from zero.  Valuations have been a key part of the underlying analysis and remain troubling - especially given that analysts’ forecasts of US corporate earnings still show earnings growth for the S&P500 - despite the fact these this has begun to fall and with no reversal in sight. The prospective P/E ratio is 15.6x for the current year, but on estimates we cannot believe. The first Q4 2015 results were released last week and while there were quite a few ‘beats’, this was often because earnings expectations had been reduced dramatically in recent weeks!  In addition, the P/E is likely to be compressed as the Presidential election gets nearer. Longer-term value indicators look even more troubling on a historical basis, with the Shiller P/E (also referred to as ‘CAPE’, or cyclically adjusted P/E) recently at 24x, versus the long-term average for the US at 16.7x.  Brokers’ bottom-up forecasts for S&P500 earnings this year currently suggest earnings growth of 8.9% this year, and this consensus has fallen from growth of 11.8% a month ago (after a small estimated fall for 2015). Analysts as a group tend to be too bullish, and listen too slavishly to the companies they follow for fear of upsetting them and wrecking corporate relationships.  US stocks are now facing a profit recession, defined as two quarters of declining profits. We expect this to be led not just by the energy and materials sectors, but also by the consumer discretionary sector, which has witnessed negative estimate revision for the last few months, with profit warnings and little or no positive guidance. It is the consumer that more often than not drives the US economy.  As we go to print, the technical condition of the S&P500 is now such that it is has taken out a major support level, with a very bearish technical configuration just confirmed using our favourite long-term Fibonacci moving averages.  S&P500: Last 12 months, with moving averages  Source: Bloomberg  Only about 25% of the gasoline bonus was actually being spent  built up over recent years. We haven’t been hearing about the gasoline bonus lately, even with oil prices plunging below $30/barrel. What we have been hearing - and now in far less hushed tones since we went underweight in US equities - is the ‘R’ word: recession.  Lastly in this section, readers might expect some brief mention of the US Presidential election. Seasoned investors know that governments spend prior to an election, and rein-in spending afterwards. Because equity markets tend to discount the future (by between about 9-15 months on average), uncertainty - both economic and political - increases, and P/E ratios contract, and that is almost certainly occurring at the moment. There have been various studies analyzing the market return differential in the years before vs. after US (and other) elections, supportive of the point. In the US ‘Presidential Cycle’ year two often tends to be weak, and year three strong. The UK equity market behaves in a similar manner, and is in any case highly correlated to the US equity market. We recently read about a study of the correlation between the performance of UK equities and the US Presidential cycle. When ‘New York sneezes, London (still) catches a cold.

However, late last year growth weakened and inflation fell worryingly below the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) 2% target, increasing doubt about the real effectiveness of ‘Abenomics’. China is Japan’s second-largest trading partner, and the growth recession taking place there was instrumental in Japan’s slowdown. There are expectations that the BoJ could further extend QE should deflationary pressure persist in the economy, although evidence of that willingness has not been so evident of late, causing the yen to strengthen down towards the 116 level vs. the dollar. The IMF expects Japan’s GDP to have risen from -0.1% in 2014, to 0.6% in 2015, with 1.0% growth forecast for 2016.  It is well known that Japan faces some significant headwinds in the coming years, including adverse demographics through a rapidly ageing and declining population, and of course the huge burden of government debt in excess of 250% of GDP, and this in an economy that has been trying to escape deflation for more than two decades. Having said all that, the government - and business itself - has realized that the corporate sector could become more efficient, and the potential certainly exists for this. So there  that. Manufacturing activity and the overall trade surplus have risen, helped by a weak euro, on-going QE since last March, and low oil prices. However, low inflation remains a key concern. Mario Draghi, ECB President, has said the ECB will do ‘whatever it takes’ to get inflation up. It is expected that the ECB will reduce its policy rates even further; the latest deposit rate was cut to -0.3%, and QE has been extended by six months, until March, 2017. Reducing the deposit rate by an extra 10bps made it even more profitable for banks to lend, to businesses and consumers alike. The ECB’s monetary easing does appear to have provided a short-term palliative and some stimulus to the eurozone economy, although it is of course no substitute for the hard reforms needed. Greece will surely return following its ‘quick fix’, and nationalist tensions are growing throughout. Another negative development has been that European exports are now under pressure from the slowdown in China, an important market for European luxury and consumer goods. The bottom-line is that according to the IMF, economic growth in the eurozone is expected to have been 1.5% in 2015, with 1.6% in prospect for 2016. This is probably about as good as it gets, considering the challenges the eurozone faces.  There are still serious questions about the viability of the eurozone, and such thoughts act like a heavy anvil holding equity valuations down. QE has almost certainly kept the bloc’s annualized growth rate from falling much below 1%, although it will take serious structural change for that number to move above 2% and remain there for any period of time. The ‘hard money’ element within the Bundesbank is in all likelihood dead against using any QE whatsoever, but while inflation stays low and negative rates continue to keep growth alive the case cannot be proven. We do worry that the short-term results of QE might be thought  is a reform story that we are cognizant of as we survey global equity markets. Lastly, in a ‘weight of money’ sense, the state pension funds have been told to support the market, and we assume they have obediently been doing so; however we would not rely on such an artificial factor (as in the case of China). So there is an interesting mixture of bullish and bearish aspects to be considered when one looks at this space. With serious efforts to boost ROI at corporates, for instance involving more firms introducing performance-linked remuneration and stock options, more cash will be returned to shareholders. This is a market in which good fundamental ‘value’ investing could pay off handsomely.  In 2015, Japan was one of the best performing equity markets, up by 9.9% in US dollar terms. For the current year earnings growth is estimated at 8.2%, and 10.7% in 2017. Currently, the Nikkei is trading at a 16.5x P/E multiple for the current year, falling to 14.9x for 2017.  Eurozone Many investors can’t believe that the eurozone extracted itself from crisis last year - at least until the next time. The worries regarding the ongoing disagreements between the French and the Germans, the difficulties of monetary union, and now the migration problem - to name just a few - have all kept the overall valuation of eurozone large-cap stocks (as defined by the Euro Stoxx 50 index) trailing those of international peers. Our Bloomberg print-off shows that over the last five years the Euro Stoxx 50 index has underperformed the S&P500 by 45.5% in price terms.  The eurozone business cycle remains at a ‘mid-level’ stage, although with countries such as Spain and Italy now doing much better than a few years ago; of course the eurozone contains great diversity, and we appreciate  Nikkei: Last 12 months, with moving averages Euro Stoxx 50: Last 12 months, with moving averages  Source: Bloomberg Source: Bloomberg  good enough, making reform somehow less urgent in practice.  To be overweight eurozone equities (better with a currency hedge in place) has been a popular asset allocation call, with good results last year. If 2016 were to see an improvement in consumption based on wage growth, then the case for remaining overweight in eurozone equities would be stronger. With the ECB having recently decided to pump in liquidity until March, 2017, there is atleast some case for ‘lengthening the visit’, despite the Fed moving in the opposite monetary direction. It seems to come back to this: the Fed has begun to fuel a bear market in US equities that was due in any case, while the eurozone stands a chance of limiting the spillover damage from that via its monetary easing.  The Euro Stoxx 50 Price index is currently trading on a P/E of 13.2x flat earnings for 2016, which is estimated to fall to 11.6x for 2017, assuming 13.0% earnings growth in that year. That earnings growth looks achievable to us. If investors can find genuine growth in the eurozone universe in specific stocks, such stocks will be accorded high multiples. We have always found German small- and mid-caps to be a very fertile space for astute investors. Provided investors can successfully identify above-average stock-pickers, then the discount valuation of this wider universe gives them a head start. International investors are best advised to hedge the euro exposure, at least partially.  3900  3700  3500  3300  3100  2900  2700  22000  21000  2000  19000  18000  17000  16000  15000  14000  Nikkei Index SMAVG (377) SMAVG (144) Euro Stoxx 50 SMAVG (377) SMAVG (144)  Jan-15 Feb-15 Mar-15  Apr-15 May-15 Jun-15  Jul-15 Aug-15 Sep-15  Oct-15 Nov-15 Dec-15  Jan-16 Jan-15 Feb-15 Mar-15  Apr-15 May-15 Jun-15  Jul-15 Aug-15 Sep-15  Oct-15 Nov-15 Dec-15  Jan-16   eMeRgINg MaRkeT eqUITy OUTlOOk eMeRgINg MaRkeT eqUITy OUTlOOk  NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  16 17  EMERgIng MARkET EqUITY oUTlook South Korea Last year the South Korean economy was hit by two shocks: an outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and a slowdown in demand in Asian countries that reduced overall output growth to around 2.7%. Korean domestic demand has stabilized post the MERS outbreak, but the environment for exports remains challenging with the well-publicized economic transition in China.  In 2016, it is expected that the Bank of Korea will continue to maintain its accommodative monetary stance. With inflation below the target range of 2.5% to 3.5%, an additional cut in the policy interest rate before the National Assembly elections in April, 2016, would be beneficial. The IMF expects South Korean GDP to have grown at 2.7% last year, and expects growth of 3.2% in 2016. In 2015, South Korea’s KOSPI Index declined by 4.6%, compared to a fall in the MSCI EM Index of 17% in 2015.  During the last twelve months corporate earnings estimates have been revised upwards by 4.6%. The market is trading on a forward P/E ratio of 11.0x for the current year, and 9.8x for 2017, based on earnings growth of 28.6% in the current year, and 12.1% in 2017.  Brazil In 2015, Brazilian equities fell sharply, by 49.8% in US dollar terms, after the real depreciated by 50%. Brazil has been experiencing a severe economic downturn, with real GDP expected to  have shrunk by 3.5% last year, with a fall of 2.5% expected this year. Commodity prices are not yet offering any respite, and confidence in policy-makers remains very weak in the wake of the corruption investigation centred on Petrobras. While a weak Brazilian real could help support exports and tourism, the outlook for commodity prices remains uncertain, as does the state of the Chinese economy. The elevated inflation rate (at 9.5% in December) could cause interest rates to be increased further, while fiscal austerity will continue to damage aggregate demand. Any recovery in business confidence hinges on clearing the political logjam.  During the last twelve months corporate earnings were revised downwards by 18%. The equity market is trading on a prospective P/E of 9.7x for 2016, based on an assumed earnings recovery of 128%, off a very low base.  Argentina Argentina witnessed a change of government in the fourth quarter of last year, when Mr. Mauricio Macri, a right-winger, took over as President, which was a major change after 12 years of leftist governments. Mr Macri is pro-business. The currency has been allowed to float freely, as a result of which the peso depreciated by 30% last year.

The loose currency regime does carry the risk of a new inflation scare, a perennial problem of Argentina. In 2015, Argentinian equities fell by 10.4% in local price terms, during which corporate earnings for that year were revised upwards by 24.3%.  The market is trading on a prospective P/E ratio of 10.6x for 2016, falling to 7.7x for 2017, based on estimated earnings growth of 177.3% (like Brazil, if it occurs it will be off a very low base) for this year, and 38.1% for next.  43000  38000  33000  28000  23000  18000  Argentina BURCAP Index SMAVG (377) SMAVG (144)  62000  57000  52000  47000  42000  37000  32000  2250  2150  2050  1950  1850  1750  KOSPI Index SMAVG (377) SMAVG (144)  Brazil Ibovespa Index SMAVG (377) SMAVG (144)  Jan-15 Feb-15 Mar-15  Apr-15 May-15 Jun-15  Jul-15 Aug-15 Sep-15  Oct-15 Nov-15 Dec-15  Jan-16 Jan-15 Feb-15 Mar-15  Apr-15 May-15 Jun-15  Jul-15 Aug-15 Sep-15  Oct-15 Nov-15 Dec-15  Jan-16  Jan-15 Feb-15 Mar-15  Apr-15 May-15 Jun-15  Jul-15 Aug-15 Sep-15  Oct-15 Nov-15 Dec-15  Jan-16   India As detailed elsewhere in this book, India’s ‘hope’ investment trade since the Modi government took over has been impeded by the lack of key reforms passed to date, together with an increasing realization that corporate capital expenditure shows few signs of recovery. Domestic consumption(mainly urban consumption) and public investment have been key drivers of GDP growth in the current fiscal year (ending March, 2016). The government may have to relax the fiscal deficit target and continue with government spending, while at the same time attempting to push through key reforms. Recent GDP growth was 1-1.5 percentage points higher than it otherwise might have been, thanks to lower oil prices.  Corporate earnings for 2015 were revised downwards by 15% during the year, however are expected to grow by 10.5% in 2016, followed by 15.3% in 2017. The market is currently trading at a P/E of 16.8x for the current year, falling to 14.6x for 2017.  Russia The Russian economy continued to face many headwinds last year, mainly due to lower oil prices. The ruble depreciated by 25.2% against the dollar in 2015, driven by oil and the sanctions imposed by western countries. According to the IMF, economic growth is estimated to have contracted by 3.8% in 2015, although this turned out to have been less than President Putin had foreshadowed many months earlier. If oil prices remain close to current levels, it is estimated that GDP could shrink by a further 2% this year, according to the Russian Central Bank. In 2015, Russia produced 10.73 m b/d of oil (and gas condensate), one of the highest rates of production in the post-Soviet era.  Russia was one the best performing equity markets in 2015, with the main index up by 1.2% in price terms. During the year, 2015 earnings were revised downwards by just under 43%, clearly a fair assessment and coming as no  the state-owned banks that are a severe drag on the economy. The transition from an industrial to a consumption-led economy is proving to be quite difficult.  The IMF recently indicated the renminbi will join the SDR basket this year after all. The Chinese authorities want their currency lower, and will try to smooth the fall beforehand. For them, it’s better to have depreciation now (which helps the beleaguered manufacturing sector), prior to SDR basket entry, after which they know prospective renminbi investment buyers will need stability in that currency if it is to become the true reserve currency they desire. Chinese foreign exchange reserves have been falling, but they still remain very large indeed, in the region of $3.3 trillion.  Do we believe that the Chinese equity market will ultimately come right? Yes, once the Chinese begin to more properly regulate their markets. Economically, at least they have more scope to loosen monetary policy further, as well as the will and ability to crank-up fiscal expenditure, including on large infrastructure projects.  While the Chinese equity markets are as yet not important in a ‘weight of money’ sense (i.e. that in relation to its underlying GDP the market is ‘under-capitalized’, and that de facto Chinese equities are under-owned) international investors are worried that the authorities there simply don’t know what they are doing - and why should they, actually? They are still learning how to be capitalists. In a few years, we expect the weighting of Chinese equities within, for instance, the MSCI All Country index will rise from the current level of 2.7%, and possibly substantially, in time pushing global investors (especially tracker funds) into Chinese stocks. Currently, however, that pressure does not exist. Meanwhile, some domestic investors have lost money, but let’s not forget that the savings rate of the average Chinese consumer is in the region of 30%!

China For many months (like most other commentators) we have not believed the official slightly sub-7% annualized GDP growth rate, despite the apparent strength of the services side of the Chinese economy.

These factors remain as the primary drivers for 2016, complicated by the Fed rate outlook, continued commodity turbulence, and considerable Chinese uncertainties. We envisage specific currency risks, for instance due to policy rigidity in Nigeria, or a poor fiscal backdrop and reliance on external debt in Sri Lanka. Additionally, frontier market currencies could face further challenges from ongoing competitive currency devaluation with the renminbi being in the vanguard of this. We believe, however, that frontier markets will provide excellent investment opportunities for the medium-to-long term, driven by favourable demographics, economic development off an often low base, low valuations, and limited correlation with other asset classes making them excellent diversifiers in global portfolios. In 2015, frontier markets generated a -17.3% return overall, similar to the -17.0% return from emerging markets. We expect to see some good buying opportunities in frontier market equities in 2016. Regular investment in a fund targeting highly prospective frontier markets should pay off very well over time.  Vietnam In 2015, the Vietnamese market benefited from easing of the restriction on foreign ownership, and the initial agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Sustained inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into manufacturing have facilitated Vietnam’s export growth in recent years. Domestic consumption is growing robustly, helped by lower inflation and  improved consumer confidence. In 2015, the Vietnamese stock market gained 6.1% in local currency terms. However, as China is Vietnam’s largest trading partner, the Vietnamese dong is sensitive to movements in the renminbi. The State Bank of Vietnam devalued the dong against the US dollar last year, and widened the trading band from 1% to 3%, following the renminbi devaluation. The dong depreciated by 5.1% against the dollar in 2015.  Vietnam, as a party to the TPP, is negotiating a number of other trade deals and has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with the EU. The TPP involves 12 countries: the US, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam, who have come together to reduce barriers to trade and foreign investment. Vietnam is expected to be a major beneficiary of the deal; for example, Vietnamese garment exports will enjoy tariff-free access to the US, compared to an 8.4% tariff currently, so a major price advantage will accrue to Vietnamese manufacturers once the deal is fully ratified. More importantly, the local content requirements of the deal will make sure that Vietnam’s attractiveness due to its low-cost base is reinforced, providing further stimulus to export-oriented FDI. Once the TPP is implemented, Vietnamese economic growth could be boosted by up to 2%.  Despite the economic slump affecting many other emerging economies in Asia, we are positive on the Vietnamese economy. GDP growth for 2015 is expected to have been about 6.5%, the highest since 2007, and should exceed this on average during 2016-2020, with 7% being achievable. The government aims to achieve this growth via reforms, consolidating institutions and laws, investing more in education and training, and improving national infrastructure.  We expect the Vietnamese stock market to attract more foreign interest, and as companies increase their foreign ownership limits. It should be assumed that the dong will continue to gradually weaken, to maintain its competitive edge against the US dollar and renminbi; as investors that is not a concern to us given the medium-term attractiveness of this market. Lastly, of course Vietnam remains a Communist country, although one that is in a variety of ways embracing aspects of capitalism. The Communist Party National Congress will take place early in 2016, and a new leadership will be appointed, however in reality not much should change and the country’s solid growth trajectory should be unaffected.  Pakistan Pakistan is emerging as a favourite amongst frontier market investors, as greater political stability, the lower oil price, progress on  addressing energy shortages, improving business confidence and capital expenditure all continue to be supportive. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is turning out to be a key anchor in Pakistan’s investment story, with 15% of total intended capex of $46 billion already in the process of being spent. The execution progress being made in the CEPC project shows the perceived urgency of the project; it also highlights the ‘administrative’ support that the still-influential army is providing.  An improvement in external financial balances have buoyed foreign exchange reserves, which have now reached $20 billion, up 27% year-on-year, lending support to the currency which was only down by 4.2% last year vs. the US dollar. Moody’s and S&P have raised their ‘outlook’ on Pakistan from stable, to positive, acknowledging progress on fiscal consolidation and reforms. Lower inflation and better government financials are providing a backdrop for easier monetary conditions, all of which support continued GDP growth. The economy is expected to grow at 5% in 2016, and the fiscal deficit is expected to remain less than 5% of GDP. The security environment in Pakistan continues to improve, with the government remaining strongly committed to cracking down on terrorist activities. The overall improvement seen in the country as described should be very heartening for investors. Ongoing geo-political risk has to be accepted, although this seems reflected in the valuation of the market. More specifically a change in the military leadership is expected towards the end of 2016, although our understanding is that this shouldn’t be at all problematic. We believe a market status upgrade to ‘emerging’ is now probable during the current year; this would obviously be a very positive event and be an important catalyst for the market.  Sri Lanka Sri Lanka saw a change of government last year, perceived as ‘governance-positive’ due to power concentration in the previous regime, although it was judged ‘growth-negative’ that the incoming government re-evaluated its project policy that they thought had been too skewed towards Chinese contractors. However, the continuation of many projects is positive.  We expect to see some good buying opportunities  in frontier market equities in 2016   fRONTIeR eqUITy MaRkeT OUTlOOk fRONTIeR eqUITy MaRkeT OUTlOOk 22 23  NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  Despite a good outlook for growth, the fiscal deficit continues to be too high, at around 6% of GDP. Elevated debt levels and refinancing requirements for external debt are causing dollar liquidity issues for the country, and Sri Lankan dollar bond yields have firmed during the last six months. Consumption-driven imports - which are expected to further increase due to a reduction in income taxes in the 2016 budget - mean the currency outlook could drive monetary policy. Currency controls recently had to be relaxed because of an increase in the trade deficit due to consumption-related imports being sucked in, and despite the benefit of lower oil prices.  Going forward, expectations for Sri Lankan GDP growth appear stable at around 5-6% over the next three years, in the view of the IMF. Improved engagement from India is expected, either through a bridge link between the two countries, and/or more corporate FDI. Otherwise, tourism has been growing at a healthy rate (+18% in 2015). The outlook for continued domestic consumption growth remains positive for 2016.  Kenya Kenya was the worst performer in our frontier market universe last year, with a decline of 34%. Poor agricultural exports, a persistent current account deficit of above 7.5% of GDP (despite the benefit of lower oil prices), and a poor outlook for tourism due to security threats continue to pose a risk to the country’s short term outlook. Last year the central bank took strong measures in the form of increasing the benchmark interest rate by 300 bps over just two months in an attempt to curtail inflation and currency depreciation. Economic growth expectations for the country are still around 6%, and completion of ‘big ticket’ projects should help external account balances.  Bangladesh Bangladesh is expected to continue as a domestic growth story, supported by political stability, improving external balances, and a stable currency. Growth expectations in Bangladesh remain close to 6%. Looking ahead we expect strong remittance inflows and textile-driven  exports to help keep the current account balance under control and to be supportive of the currency.  Nigeria Declining oil prices, political change, and a disconnect between investors’ macro expectations and policy guidance all contributed to a 26% fall in the Nigerian stock market in 2015. Lower policy rates and non-devaluation rhetoric raised concerns regarding capital controls as it meant that the central bank might have to ring-fence foreign exchange reserves, and that a sharp currency adjustment would have to occur sooner or later (e.g. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan’s devaluations were significant), leading to greater capital outflows. So 2016 has begun with this negative expectation. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have resulted through the elevated  offshore market exchange rate. Another complication is that the new administration plans to embark on an import substitution drive. A fiscal deficit projected at 2.2% of GDP for the current year might need to be partly funded through Eurobond issuance, yet uncertainty regarding the currency mitigates against being able to do this. National foreign reserves stand at only about 5-6% of GDP (versus close to 100% for Saudi Arabia), making the defence of a de-facto dollar peg rather a tall order.  We are positive about the new President, Muhammadu Buhari, who has brought in professionals at key organizations, carried out a management restructuring at Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and streamlined its supply chain, and led a renewed crackdown on corruption and oil theft.  After the sharp correction in the Nigerian market in 2015, it may well look attractive from a valuation perspective, although prospective investors will want to see (a) an adequate currency devaluation, (b) the successful implementation of reforms, and (c) stability in the oil price would of course be helpful. The Petroleum Industry Bill remains stuck in the parliament. Our natural stance towards Nigerian equities currently tends towards a very underweight position, although the relatively large size of the market suggests we will continue to follow it in the hope that the issues described above can be resolved over time, and that some genuine alpha might be found.  Conclusions While the long-term growth arguments for frontier markets, based on attractive demographics, infrastructure spending and financial intermediation remain intact, in the near-term investors want to see individual countries’ reforms being delivered as promised, clear signs of domestic growth, a more helpful backdrop in terms of global growth and commodity prices, and a sense that FDI outflows have completed their move to the downside. As far as we can see, Vietnam and Pakistan are the kinds of markets likely to continue to be of interest to us. Lastly, the table above demonstrates the extent to which frontier equity markets have demonstrated a lack of correlation with the major markets, making the former excellent diversifiers within properly diversified investment portfolios.

Geopolitical factors; especially Iran and Russia need to see higher prices  Demand - Oil demand increased last year; the US EIA (Energy Information Administration) estimated it rose by 1.5% - …however supply rose by a larger  amount (by an estimated 2.6%, see table), swelling identifiable stocks - Lower pump prices have stimulated demand, but the EIA was expecting a  mild Northern Hemisphere winter  - …this has been worse than expected, affecting short-term sentiment - The EIA recently revised their demand forecasts down, but only slightly  (+1.5% for 2016 and 2017) - North America accounted for 25% of oil demand last year, Asia 33% (China  was 12%), and Europe was 15% - Oil demand has been growing steadily, and this should remain, helped by  lower prices - Chinese demand probably rose by 3.0% last year, with 2.8% growth expected  for 2016, and 2.6% for 2017  (a) Weighted by oil consumption (b) foreign currency per u.s. dollar   NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  Supply - A year ago, Saudi Arabia decided to target higher-cost (especially US shale) producers by increasing supply… - …which has contributed to the oil price  plunging below the lows of 2008 - …however Saudi Arabia is now coming under growing economic pressure - can  they stay the course? - …The Iraqi government has said that their oil output reached a record high in  December (at 4.13 m b/d) - Iran’s ultimate supply potential could be 3-4 m b/d - In addition to Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and  Iran’s efforts to ramp-up, Russia is pumping hard - The EIA expects OPEC to produce at an average of 32.16 m b/d in 2016, rising to  32.72 m b/d in 2017 - Wood Mackenzie says 45 upstream projects worth circa. $200 billion have  been deferred in the last 12 months - It will take longer for US shale producers to be dealt a crushing blow; only the  higher-cost wells have closed - Although the US rig count is down, much shale production is unaffected, down to  cash-costs of $20! (Goldman) - …even if only 500,000-1 m. b/d of shale production ceases this year, it will easily  be replaced from elsewhere - New US shale output in recent years is about 5% of global production, so cuts so  far = only 1% of world output - The IEA estimated global oil supply was close to 95.7 m b/d in 2015, or +2.6% for  the year - …with two-thirds of the increase coming from OPEC producers  The Demand/Supply Balance; Commercial Stock Levels - The full global demand/supply/stock matrix of oil is complicated, with  numerous factors affecting it - …so analysts tend to look at identifiable stocks as an arbiter; the US EIA projects  this to grow further - Global oil inventories have grown to an all-time high, estimated to have been  3.06 billion barrels at year-end - Storage tanks around the world have been substantially filled, with a huge  amount stored at sea  The OUTlOOk fOR OIl IN 2016 27 The OUTlOOk fOR OIl IN 2016 26  - The EIA was recently expecting supply and demand to be in better balance by the end of 2016, although… “a lot can happen between now and (the end of) 2016”- acknowledging much uncertainty  Other Market Factors; Short Positions & Forward Sales - Hedge fund bets against oil rose before the last OPEC meeting, assuming output  would remain high… - At the end of last year the short positions in WTI and Brent could have been 9  days’ consumption - Prior to the short squeeze of 21st-22nd January, the short position had been  making the market edgy - Producers remain under-hedged; for 2016 they were only 18% forward-sold, vs. an  average of 30% in 2013-15 - …and this was recently at a tiny 4% for 2017 (!) - this is surely bound to increase,  capping prices - Last week Russia was quoted as having announced they wanted to sell some of  their forward production - In our opinion forward-selling would likely accelerate if prices rallied much  above $40 - Russia and Iran have been cementing their alliance in the Middle East by  deepening business ties - …and conspiracy theorists may have a point when they foretell danger for Saudi  Arabia as a result  Discussion If Saudi Arabia for the sake of argument were to cut production after all, there is now an even longer list of producers ready to fill that gap. For at least the next few years there do appear to be solid fundamental reasons why oil prices are likely to remain in a trading range, and heavily capped on the upside at $45-50 in the current year. Below $30, demand will be stimulated and US shale oil and Canadian oil sands producers will be hit - whilst at the upper end of the range (say towards $45), producer forward-selling will almost certainly materialize, as would renewed US shale production, both strengthening towards $50 if such a price resulted from a severe geopolitical event.  The US EIA is currently forecasting WTI will average $38.54 in the current year, and $40.15 for Brent, compared to averages of $48.67 and $52.32 respectively for last year, and vs. $29.56 for WTI. WTI for delivery in December, 2019, is quoted at $45. The EIA are assuming averages of $47 and $50 for WTI and Brent in 2017. The ‘price cap’ factors mentioned above will still be there in 2017, but producers will target higher forward-selling prices. In summary, we agree with the latest EIA forecasts and recommend they be used for investment assumptions, whereas we had thought their higher forecasts for 2016 from last year were too optimistic.  Further considering the likelihood of low prices persisting, the existing physical inventory levels are truly substantial, and we feel the magnitude of the price fall seen suggests they must be understated. Think of the tonnages at sea. Based on EIA assumptions, at the end of 2013 identifiable commercial stocks represented 27.9 days of consumption; at the end of 2014 this had risen to 29.4 days. By the end of last year the figure had risen to 32.6 days. We have used some analytical license here, but the reader will take the point. By the end of the current year stocks could rise further to 32.9 days’ consumption, before finally moderating slightly to 32.4 days by the end of 2017. Such fundamental reasoning makes for ‘lower for longer’, certainly, but investors will nonetheless be able to generate returns by trading the anticipated range at its extremes.

The UAE was the first nation  in the GCC to respond to the oil price decline. State energy subsidies have been reduced, non-critical projects have been postponed, and alternative methods to fund government spending are being considered, including VAT, income and corporate taxes, privatizations, and bond sales.  - The GCC oil exporters’ decisions to focus on fiscal policy strongly suggest that for the time being they will maintain their currency regimes, despite pressures resulting from them.  - The GCC currency pegs force governments to follow US monetary decisions, irrespective of whether this is appropriate; because the GCC economies, especially Saudi Arabia, are slowing down, they could be facing monetary tightening at the wrong time.   - During 2016, the GCC region is expected register an overall fiscal deficit of around 10% of GDP, indicating continued vulnerability unless oil prices rally and/or there are further spending cuts.   - Saudi Arabia registered a fiscal deficit of 16% of GDP in 2015 (~ $ 100 billion), and is expected to register a budget deficit of 13% of GDP in 2016.  - The Saudi riyal is thought to be theoretically overvalued by around 16-17% vs. their main trading partners’  currencies. On a similar basis, the UAE dirham could be overvalued by more than 25%.  - Despite the asset depletion mentioned earlier, the GCC countries as a group have financial buffers in place, together with low sovereign debt, and are therefore better prepared than many other oil-exporting nations for low oil prices.  - Government spending in the GCC countries, although at reduced levels, will still be at levels considered healthy by many other nations.  - In 2015, oil revenues are expected to  NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  MEnA EConoMIC oUTlook The MENA region as a whole consists of 17 nations. In 2014, it was estimated to have around 465 million people, and total output worth about $4.2 trillion, at higher oil prices. In 2015, after the fall in oil prices we estimate this may have fallen to US$3.8 trillion. We are including the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.  According to 2014 official data, the biggest economy in the region was Turkey ($810 billion), followed by Saudi Arabia ($750 billion), and then the UAE ($400 billion). The most populous nation is Egypt (87 million), followed by Iran (79 million), and then Turkey (77 million).  The MENA region as a whole is expected to have achieved economic growth of 2.7% in 2015, with common sense alone suggesting that with much lower oil prices, growth will be lower in the current year. Iran’s integration into the global economy and improved growth in oil importing countries is expected to at least partially off-set the impact of the fall in oil prices. The countries will be separated into ‘Oil Exporting’ and ‘Oil Importing’ for simplicity of analysis.  Oil Exporting Nations These are Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. - The outlook for the oil exporting  countries is generally and unsurprisingly quite difficult as they adjust to the ‘new normal’ of oil prices being in a rather lower range.  - Supply pressures are expected to persist  for the time being in the oil market, with extra supply expected to come on from Iran and Iraq.  - Iran is expected to reach pre-sanction oil production levels by the end of 2016, meaning an additional 500,000-700,000 million barrels.  - Saudi Arabia is estimated to have an additional 1.5-2.0 million barrels of capacity available.  - With serious pressure on budgets, almost all the exporters will register ‘twin deficits’ (current account and fiscal) for 2015/16. Due to fiscal adjustments, however, the magnitude of these deficits is expected to decline in the current year.  Due to fiscal adjustments budget deficits as a % of GDP are  expected to decline this year  MeNa eCONOMIC OUTlOOk 28  At least for the time being GCC oil exporters will maintain their  currency pegs, despite the pressures of doing so   NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  MeNa eCONOMIC OUTlOOk 31 MeNa eCONOMIC OUTlOOk 30  have constituted about 65% of producers’ government revenues.  - The GCC nations are estimated to have had about $3 trillion in net foreign assets at the end of 2014, and during 2015 are thought to have seen depletion of about $210 billion of that total amount. We expect that a further $180 billion or so of assets could be depleted in the current year.  - The UAE, due to high energy prices received over the years, has been able to build substantial reserves from fiscal surpluses. The UAE seems to be weathering the storm better than other oil exporting nations. Economic growth for the country has been revised downwards to about 2.5% for 2016. Growth in the private sector has slowed, and liquidity in the banking sector has tightened.  - The UAE has over the years taken steps to diversify its economy away from its previous reliance on hydrocarbons. In 2015, non-oil and gas sectors are expected to have constituted about 75% of nominal GDP. In 2016, according to official sources, the UAE economy is expected to grow by 2.5%. The lifting of sanctions on Iran should boost bilateral trade activity. With various measures to support government revenues, we expect the UAE’s budget deficit could fall to about 4% of GDP this year.  Oil Importing Nations These include Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey.  - During 2015 the oil importers benefited from the oil price decline, and economic growth rose to an estimated collective 3.2%, up from 2.6% in 2014.  - The outlook for the countries in this group remains overshadowed by geopolitical tensions relating to the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Libya.  - The outlook and the growth potential for the eight nations are very different:  - Egypt: Even though the country is expected to register twin deficits and has significant levels of debt, investor confidence has improved significantly during recent years. The country now enjoys improved political stability, facilitating improvement in the business environment, while the establishment of large infrastructure projects in energy, logistics, transportation, and housing should have a positive impact once the currency depreciation issue is dealt with. Egypt’s banking system is profitable and in good shape. (Please see our separate report on Egypt elsewhere in this publication).   - Tunisia: The country is making significant progress in democratic representation, and government authorities are making special efforts to follow the program put in place by the IMF, which is in turn facilitating bringing in outside aid. Reforms are being implemented although some say the pace is quite slow. The conflict in Libya has had some side-effects. The tourism sector was negatively affected last year because of the terror attack. The economy is expected to have grown at just 1% in 2015, although some improvement is possible this year. Tunisia’s banking sector is experiencing liquidity problems because of a reduction in deposits, and NPL’s have been increasing. External debt is at manageable levels, and the debt-to-GDP ratio is not excessive.   - Jordan: Despite turmoil in its immediate neighbors, Jordan has itself been able to avoid conflict. International aid from the GCC and IMF, coupled with economic reforms resulted in reasonable growth mild growth in 2015. The central bank implemented several measures to stimulate the economy, and Jordan has benefited greatly from the oil price decline. Business and investor sentiment has obviously been adversely affected by wider conflict in the region, which has led  to disruption in economic activity. Fiscal and current account balances are improving, helped by inward remittances and foreign aid.   - Lebanon: The country has not had a President for almost a year, and the elections have been postponed, probably into 2017. Lebanon has significant debt levels, estimated to be 130% of GDP, making international financing difficult, and costly to access. Growth is expected to have been less than 2% in 2015. Lebanon has suffered from having to cope with a very high number of refugees. Unsurprisingly the short-to-medium term outlook is not bright. Economic growth this year and next depends on election results, the implementation of reforms, and the conclusion of the civil wars in Syria and Iraq.  - Morocco: is a relative success story in the region, driven by its strong  agricultural sector. The country has been successful in implementing reforms effectively, for instance its removal of energy subsidies. Political stability following a quicker transition to democracy, and coupled with the reforms helped the country to register strong growth of nearly 5% in 2015.   - Turkey: The country has to an extent benefited from declining oil prices. Unfortunately the Turkish lira depreciated substantially against the dollar, reducing the positive impact of the oil price decline. The short-term does not appear positive as Turkey is struggling with security concerns, tensions in the region and the effect of the sanctions imposed by Russia following the recent downing of the Russian jet. The latest round of terror attacks and the tensions with Russia are expected to severely affect tourism revenues (these are about $28 billion), and are hence important to the country.

The benefits of stable currency regimes continue to outweigh the negatives in the minds of officials, especially in this period of stress. Having said this, Kuwait set a precedent a few years ago by linking its currency to a basket of currencies, and this appears to have worked. Despite various of the region’s currencies appearing theoretically overvalued - and especially with oil prices trading close to $30 - we don’t expect currently unnecessary changes to be made soon.  We don’t foresee any slippage regarding reforms, even if oil prices recovered, because fiscal breakeven oil prices are still higher than the authorities would like them to be, and fiscal arrangements similar to those seen in the West are now being steadily introduced. As more of the growth burden is borne by the private sector across the GCC oil producers, more industrial diversification across equity indices should result.  Given the heavy weighting of Saudi Arabia in the MENA equity mix, the recent Saudi budget for 2016 was a significant event. It focused on three key factors: improving efficiency of government spending, economic diversification and fiscal consolidation. The government forecasts that the fiscal deficit will narrow in 2016 to SAR 326.2 billion ($87 billion), from SAR 367 billion ($98 billion) in 2015. In 2016, the fiscal deficit should be financed by domestic and global debt issuance. The Saudi market is expected to enter the MSCI EM Index in 2017, and this should be positive for regional equities generally. Looking elsewhere, the well-diversified UAE economy and stock market sectors contained within the Dubai and Abu  and financials, which will be feeling the brunt of tightening monetary conditions in local economies. A recovery of, and some stability in oil prices will ultimately determine the timing of any re-rating in MENA equity markets. In the near-term and as we go to print market performances will likely remain volatile. Markets generally overshoot on the upside and the downside, and we expect to see some good buying opportunities leading to the generation of decent returns by the end of 2016.  NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  MEnA EqUITIES oUTlook 2015 turned out to be a challenging year for MENA equity markets. On the back of persistent declines in oil prices, MENA markets corrected by 17% overall. Oil of course continues to play an important role in the region, despite various steps taken by the GCC oil-producing countries to diversify their economies. Today, the key question facing any investor in MENA equities is whether we have we seen the bottom, or it is yet to come? Although these are difficult questions and attempting to time the market is not easy (or advisable), what is clearly evident is the fact that post-correction, market valuations are looking reasonably compelling. Currently, MENA equities looked at collectively are trading at the lower end of their five-year P/E range, and on a relative P/E basis are at close to a 30% discount to the MSCI World Index.  As discussed elsewhere in this book, we expect oil prices to remain within a low range, at least for the current half-year, and this scenario could lead to further volatility for MENA equities. Economically, we still expect the region to grow between about 2.2% and 2.5% in 2016, given the apparent commitment to non-oil & gas projects. Wealthy regional governments are undeterred in their strategies to continue to spend in a counter-cyclical, almost Keynesian manner. Low oil prices have brought challenges for the region, but on the other hand they have provided the stimulus to embark on much-needed reforms, in turn leading to long-term benefits for MENA economies - and ultimately to improved corporate earnings and equity valuations. Each country within the GCC has its own unique features, and the exact mix of reform options varies, according to a range of factors such as their population profiles.

Banking and real estate remain quite heavily-weighted in UAE equity markets, hence these sectors are important to international investors wishing to put money to work.  The long-awaited verdict regarding the Qatar/FIFA world cup is out and we expect the related infrastructure projects to gather momentum in 2016, supporting economic growth. Looking ahead across the region, continued government spending on other strategic projects such as EXPO 2020 will drive growth not only up to and during, but also beyond the due date.

Some economists see yields somewhat higher by year end, with this view being questioned by a noteworthy and growing portion of the investor community, highlighting that slow growth and disinflation point to the persistence of low yields. Credit strategists generally see excess returns ahead even though yield spreads are not forecast to narrow significantly (or indeed at all). Thus a move to much higher or lower yields and spreads is not the ‘central case’ forecast.  What are the main drivers of these views? What are the longer-term themes? What are the key risks that could cause more extreme outcomes?  One of the common, big-picture valuation metrics used by bond investors to get a sense of the centre of gravity for government bond yields (and the distance from this centre) is a comparison of nominal yields with trend nominal GDP growth - nominal GDP growth being comprised of real GDP growth plus inflation, and trend real GDP growth being comprised of expected productivity growth and growth of the workforce (hours worked). So far so good, except that two of the biggest puzzles of recent times are productivity growth and inflation. For the major economies, productivity growth has been non-existent, and inflation has been lower than many, including the central banks, expected.  Many of the views invloving mean reversion to higher yields are based on either misplaced notions about recent productivity growth, or beliefs that it will  move higher that are not well supported by discussion. US productivity growth has fallen from 2.3% for the 1994 to 2004 period, to 1% recently.  Putting all this together, the OECD has potential GDP growth for the US at around 1.6%; for the eurozone it is 1%, and for Japan 0.4%. Look around at the other estimates and you might push the US up to 2%, and the eurozone towards 1.5%. China might come in as high as 6.5%. Our sense is that many have a higher number for the US - and hence global GDP growth - in mind. The debate about productivity growth, the role of technology and its impact on productivity in the future is very much alive and needs to be watched. For now, assuming it is low and will remain so for a while makes sense to us.  Likewise, the outlook for inflation appears to be dominated by low inflation scenarios in the major economies, and heading lower globally. Clearly, all four of the major central banks (Fed, ECB, Bank of Japan and PBOC) are making policy changes based on this view, as inflation measures in all these countries continue to come in below expectations. The weakness of commodity prices is obvious to all and is evidence of both over-supply and weak demand. Arguably one of the best indicators of broader disinflation pressures is Chinese producer prices, which were recently falling by 5.9% year-on-year, the lowest since the 2008 crisis.  Putting all these factors together the probability appears to be that investors’ in bonds should expect continued low yields. Against this backdrop, our thoughts quickly turn to one of the other big structural issues - debt, and to the cyclical situation.  One of our favourite reports of 2015 appeared early in the year, from the McKinsey Global Institute, titled ‘Debt and (Not Much) Deleveraging’. Whilst not the only report to remind us about debt levels and debt dynamics, it was one of the best at communicating the  For the major  economies, productivity growth has been non-existent, and inflation has been lower than  many, expected.   challenges faced in both developing and emerging countries. As it noted in the introduction, “After the 2008 financial crisis and the longest and deepest global recession since World War II, it was widely expected that the world’s economies would deleverage. It has not happened. Instead, debt continues to grow in nearly all countries, in both absolute terms and relative to GDP. This creates fresh risks in some countries and limits growth prospects in many others. Total debt within China is rising rapidly. Fueled by real estate and shadow-banking, China’s total debt has quadrupled, rising from $7 trillion in 2007, to $28 trillion by mid-2014. At 282% of GDP, China’s debt as a share of GDP, while manageable, is larger than that of the United States or Germany.”  In simple terms there seem to be three big challenges highlighted by the above statement the high level of debt across sectors (government, household and corporate) in the developed world and China, the fast increase in debt levels over recent years in the emerging economies, and the heavy use of US dollar debt during this phase (these latter two points have been the focus of many reports in recent months). Whilst economic history supports the point that McKinsey make about limited growth prospects, it is much less clear in which precise ways and over what time periods debt levels and build-ups will impact both growth, and more importantly for us, financial markets. These issues are very important for us and at the forefront of our analysis.  At the time of writing the level of activity in the major economies can be summarized as ‘not too hot, and not too cold’, although global growth forecasts are continuing to weaken. The global economy is growing somewhere around 3% or just below, some way below estimates of trend at 3.5% or higher. This is due to emerging economies that are growing some way below trend, at 3% versus 5% respectively, whilst developed economies are growing in line with trend, at a little below 2%. The debt situation  NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  36 37  noted above suggests to us that a continuation around these levels remains a reasonable central case.  Central bank and government policies support this view. The Fed is set to hike rates gradually, whilst the ECB, BoJ and PBOC have all signaled that monetary policy will remain easy or get easier. In China, in particular, the government has also been active with fiscal policy and although overall debt levels in China are high, government debt-to-GDP levels are not and hence the government has the capacity to continue this fiscal push.  Downside risks to this view (i.e. risks that growth will be lower) most obviously centre on the debt issues noted above, whereby either a gradual or more severe deleveraging takes place. The path of the US dollar will probably play an important role here too; if it strengthens further it seems inevitable that the fears about the ability of some non-US dollar borrowers to repay or refinance will rise.  An interesting point to think about is whether a sharp slowdown in growth (e.g. a growth recession - or even an outright recession) would be good or bad for government bonds. On the one hand, prospects for easier monetary policy and a flight to quality suggest it would be good. However, with developed country government debt-to-GDP levels already elevated, a recession could rekindle fears about creditworthiness that were front and centre in 2008.  Upside risks to growth and yields are harder to identify and probably require creative thinking about what the catalysts would be. The subtext is that we do not subscribe to the theory that quantitative easing (QE) is inherently inflationary and that to date inflation has merely been delayed; increasing the monetary base is one thing, increasing broad money supply and inflation is another. In the US, for instance, despite some improvement in the labour market, under-employment and the forces of technology and globalization are still powerful disinflationary forces in our  view. Therefore a significant easing of financial conditions seems to be a pre-requisite for higher US growth and yields, and it’s not obvious to us at the moment where such an easing might come from. A more limited and mundane reason for some upward pressure on yields would be that once energy prices just stabilise then headline inflation rates will rise automatically, albeit from very low or even negative levels.  The bottom line is this: even though the Fed may have ushered-in the end of the period of very low official rates on average set by the developed world’s central banks, it does not seem likely that this will be the start of a period of substantially higher yields for the developed bond markets. Factors that will keep yields low (for example, high debt and low productivity) are more obvious than factors that will push them much higher, and the latter outcome would require a fresh catalyst. This conclusion is supported by the consensus judgement, shared by us, that the ECB and Bank of Japan will either maintain their current QE programs or increase them.  Last summer, when the key 10-year US Treasury yield traded above the 2.40% level, this can now be viewed as - with the glorious benefit of hindsight - a truly significant ‘bear-trap’, as many investors had thought this heralded the final end of the multi-decade global bond bull market. Technically, this yield would now need to hold above about 2.20% to begin to suggest the end of the bull market. As we go to print, the yield is 1.97%, apparently not too low to discourage ‘safe haven’ buying during currently turbulent equity markets.  Accordingly, US Treasuries, Bunds and other high-quality, developed market bonds, including highly rated investment grade credits, should deliver positive returns in 2016. An important caveat, however, is that if we are considering shorter-dated bonds at the front end of the eurozone or Japanese curves with negative yields they might not, as there are many reasons to think that negative yields will persist. Under these circumstances, buyers of these could be facing even higher negative yields if held to redemption.

Some of the obvious questions to ask are: Will commodity prices go up or down over the year? Will the US dollar rally again? Will recent underperformers, notably Brazil, rebound? Which countries or markets are most at risk of underperforming this year? Will US Treasury returns aid - or impede - returns from hard-currency bonds? Let’s set the scene by summarizing performance in 2015, especially as the asset class actually saw great dispersion.  The EM bond market universe comprises the traditional hard currency universe and its local currency counterpart, the first containing issues from a large number of countries, and the latter originating from a smaller group. Local currency bonds came under pressure from falling currencies, impacting returns for overseas investors, and sapping demand. This may well continue in 2016. Performance for the hard currency universe is largely dependent on two factors: the return from underlying US Treasuries, and the return due to changes in credit spreads. According to the widely-used JPMorgan indices, the overall hard currency EMBI Global Diversified universe delivered small positive returns in 2015. Unsurprisingly, the regional differences revolved around commodities, with the importing regions of Central & Eastern Europe and Asia performing well, and the exporting areas of Africa performing poorly.  At the country level, classic mean-reversion behaviour saw previous underperformers doing well, with Ukraine, Argentina, and  Emerging Market Bond Index – Global Diversified Z-Spread  Source: Bloomberg  Russia delivering strong positive returns, usually due to factors outside EM dynamics: in the case of Ukraine, ‘financial assistance’ from the West over its conflict with Russia in Eastern Ukraine; Argentina now has a new pro-business administration potentially ending a decade-long quagmire for bond holders; perceived all out sanctions to be implemented at state level on Russia have receded, causing spreads to narrow, particularly in shorter-dated maturities. In the case of Russia and Ukraine, though, these moves may have run their course. On the downside, Brazil delivered very negative returns; the Rouseff Administration was already struggling with a stalled economy as commodities sold off further in 2015.  The JPMorgan GBI-EM Global Diversified local currency universe reveals a similar regional pattern, and in US dollar terms nearly all returns were negative due to the dominant influence of US dollar strength last year. Again the best performer was Russia, and the worst was Brazil, with the former +8.3%, and the latter a dreadful -30.7%.  Given the environment we see most likely to prevail, we firstly believe that relatively risk-averse investors should continue to invest in countries and companies that have reasonable quality balance sheets. At the country level, this means countries  with current account surpluses (or limited deficits), sufficient foreign exchange reserves, and limited levels of total debt. For traders, as usual there will be tactical opportunities to invest in oversold issues and currencies, but such positions should be recognized as such - i.e. purely tactical, and managed accordingly. EM economies with large amounts of external debt will find it hard to meet their commitments. Overall, default rates are likely to rise in EM sovereign and corporate debt, so it should only be very experienced traders who take risk in this space.  Our read of the consensus views is that commodities - still so important to the EM universe - could well stabilize during 2016, although no one wants to call the bottom early, with the worry that the US dollar might rise further, pushing commodity prices even lower. In 2016 the best-placed countries in the EM space, and bond-wise, will be those that benefit from falling commodity prices (at least until the ‘turn’ that few will spot until after the event!): clearly India, South Korea and the Philippines really stand out under this heading.  For traders and long-term investors, although Brazil faces continuing political and economic problems, and its sovereign  bonds have been cut to junk, impeachment and negative growth is probably already priced-in for 2016. Select opportunities have appeared for contrarian investors in Brazilian names that are either diversified away from the country or that have a niche business model more insulated from the problems at sovereign level. Elsewhere, we believe Argentina is a market holding promise for EM bond market investors.  In the event the US dollar’s strength does abate, this would give some respite to EM bonds overall. Under these circumstances we believe commodity plays in corporate bonds with strong balance sheets could recover after such a torrid year. Also, referring to one of the main conclusions from our ‘Developed’ bond article, if we are correct in thinking that US (especially 10-year) rates will track downwards this year, this should support quality EM risk assets in general, and quality EM bonds in particular. One of the things that we are most confident about is that global growth will continue to be sluggish in 2016, producing a benign interest rate environment, which is positive for selected EM bond markets. Also, the JPMorgan EMBI index shows that EM bond spreads have widened to levels not seen since 2009, and at the very least some mean-reversion is now increasingly likely. We would favour the B/BB+ space over sub-B grade, given our view above that default rates in corporate bonds will likely rise through the course of 2016.

In 2015, based on JPMorgan’s MECI index, bonds across the Middle East from GCC-based issuers returned close to 2%. Given the events of the year and the respective fiscal positions the ranking of returns by country should not come as a big surprise; at the top of the list were Qatari issuers with a return of 3.2%, supported by strong balance sheets, exposure to gas rather than oil, and a relatively good fiscal position. The strengths of the UAE, including the diversification provided by Dubai’s economy, helped returns from issuers based there, with Kuwaiti returns a little ahead of these. Equally, there is no surprise that the bottom three mainstream markets were Saudi Arabia (-1.42%), Bahrain (-2.45%) and Oman (-4.41%).  Conventional bonds and sukuk delivered similar returns, with similar volatility. Sub-investment grade bonds performed slightly better than investment grade bonds, in contrast to what happened between these classes in the US markets. Amidst this overall story there were obviously idiosyncratic risks and returns resulting from both credit and yield curve factors; for instance, although DP World had a good year from a credit metrics perspective there was limited sponsorship for long-dated issues in the region, so its 2037 bond had a very tough year and delivered a return of worse than - 7%. At the other end of the spectrum, beneficiaries of lower energy prices such as Emirates Airlines and Fly Dubai saw their bonds perform quite well, in the region of 5% returns over the year. MeNa BOND MaRkeT OUTlOOk 41  Looking at yield spread (interest rate differentials) between the MENA bonds and corresponding duration US bonds, over 2015 the spread for MENA bonds widened from 203 basis points to 278 basis points, or 0.75% in yield terms. Broad movements in these spreads are related to changes in growth and growth expectations, which for many of the MENA markets is of course mainly driven by changes in oil prices. We would argue that MENA bonds as a class tend to behave like ‘mid-beta’ assets, sitting between the high-beta bonds of Africa and Latin America on the one hand, and the low-beta bonds of Asia and Central & Eastern Europe on the other. Some commentators have argued that given deteriorating leverage metrics of issues in the MENA region, the yield spread should be wider i.e. MENA bonds as a class should sell at a greater discount/higher yield basis to developed market investment grade issues. We believe, however, that there should be due cognizance of the widespread balance sheet strength and government support in this region. Irrespective of whatever the ‘correct’ spread between these two broad asset classes should be at current oil prices, MENA bonds have had a bad start to 2016, and buyers of these today should now be able to lock-in redemption yields in quality issues in the region of 4 to 5%.  Looking forward, if oil prices begin to ‘range-trade’, rather than simply trending lower and lower, then GDP growth forecasts should finally begin to stabilize. At such a time, if spreads remain close to where they are currently, this could lead to fairly attractive returns for MENA bonds. Any sustained rally in oil prices would see spreads tighten and returns move notably higher. Having said that, of course in the event of a move in oil prices markedly lower (say towards $20) spreads would widen further and returns drift lower as we saw in 2015.  Within the wider asset class, we continue to pay close attention to financials and to banks in particular. Although sovereign issuers make up the biggest sector, at around of third of the universe, financials represent easily the biggest corporate sector, at around a quarter of the universe; as such they are important for both the performance and mood of the overall market. The current environment poses specific challenges for banks that will affect both profitability and bond supply. Whilst lending growth is expected to slow across the region, it is nevertheless expected to be positive, at around 5%. Funding this growth will be difficult as a reversal of the recent fall in public sector deposits is difficult to see,  especially given that loan-to-deposit ratios are rising amidst ongoing implementation of the Basel III regulations in the region (including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio). Thus the competition for deposits that has pushed up deposit rates is set to continue, and banks will continue to be the most active borrowers in the bond markets, with both senior and subordinated debt to be issued.  Whilst bank debt witnessed some downwards re-pricing relative to both other regional debt and comparable bank bonds internationally towards the end of 2015 - such that valuations are now looking quite fair, we think - it is possible that the new issue pipeline could maintain some upward pressure on spreads. Such pressure could well be augmented by some deterioration in loan losses and related provisions. Tighter lending standards in recent years mean that banks’ balance sheets are in good shape, although results in the first 9 months of 2015 revealed losses that were small relative to the growth slowdown witnessed, so it is possible that banking sector results announced in the first half of 2016 will reflect some increases in bad debts.  The important subject of the probable returns from underlying US interest rates has been notable by its absence in this piece i.e. in essence a discussion of the benchmark against which MENA bonds and those from other regions are compared.

According to data released by Thomson Reuters Zawya, to the end of September, 2015, GCC borrowers had only raised US$5.8 billion through international sukuk issuance, or 49% less than the same  sensitive, also within the context of a flight to quality and adherence to the Basel III rules. Having said all this, there were some large redemptions within the GCC sukuk universe in 2015, so there is thought to be good amounts of ‘sukuk-destined’ cash in the market. It looks as though ‘natural’ sukuk investors of size (such as the Islamic banks and takaful institutions) have had to deal with limited opportunities to invest. We believe the future for this form of Islamic (like other Sharia-compliant) investment looks excellent for the medium-to-long term, but for the time being the lack of supply of sukuk - and at the right price - is stifling demand and liquidity in the market.  NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  MEnA SUkUk oUTlook Whilst sukuk obviously have some fundamental differences from conventional bonds in terms of the relationship between the providers and users of capital and the nature of the capital, the cash flows in most circumstances end up being similar. Moreover, whilst there are a number of investors who will only buy sukuk, their economic rationales are similar to those who purchase conventional bonds, and the latter group of investors will normally be indifferent to whether they purchase conventional bonds or sukuk.  If we look at the make-up of the respective universes and their total returns there are more similarities than differences, notwithstanding the ‘buy-and-hold’ bias of sukuk investors. It is notable that the sovereign versus quasi-sovereign and corporate splits are similar and that the sector breakdowns for the quasi-sovereigns and corporates are also similar, all in terms of both the levels and changes through time.  The chart below shows the cumulative total returns for the ex-sukuk and sukuk indices over the past five years. Again, the two series are more notable for their similarities than differences, albeit that analysis of the volatilities reveals that returns for sukuk have been less volatile and hence measures like the Sharpe ratio will be better.  While the issuance patterns may differ for sukuk versus conventional bonds during 2016, the impacts on the overall universes should be marginal and returns, both absolute and relative, will be mainly determined by the differences and similarities noted above. Given the outlook for rising policy rates in the US, the slightly shorter maturity of the sukuk universe may be beneficial.

Uncertainty over the likely trajectory in the US rates, the bear market in oil, and increasing fiscal concerns across the region all contributed to a bearish tone in the market, causing many issuers to remain on the sidelines. Also, those windows of issuance opportunity that did occur led to a rush of issues within short periods. Having said the above, the GCC aspects were really just part of a difficult global sukuk issuance picture.

Accordingly, the ‘View from the Trading Room’ below will only have a finite shelf life. FX traders constantly process - mentally and otherwise - huge amounts of information from the markets, with the aim of spotting trends before they occur, and while the investment fundamentals are evolving. They study money flows, interest rate differentials, the cross rates between currency pairs, news flow (what is important, as opposed to just ‘background noise’?), while always having an eye on the longer-term trends. The long term is made up of shorter-term trends. Or perhaps there is no trend at all, and it might be correct to sit on the sidelines, or to trade a range. The outside world has a preconception that FX is all about speculation. In our opinion, nothing could be further from the truth. The views from our trading room can be guaranteed to change, but the degree of professionalism never will.  Euro/$ (1.09) Mario Draghi’s ‘dovish’ (rates being lowered, a view that monetary conditions should be loosened, as opposed to ‘hawkish’) suggestion that the ECB will reconsider its policy stance in March has stoked speculation of earlier than originally expected additional easing, sparking a revisit of the recent lows around 1.08 with the currency losing its safe-haven attraction. The ECB’s reconsideration of its monetary stance has for the moment caused general risk appetite to strengthen, although the global spectre of low rates for extended periods of time prevails, with risk markets (such as equities) looking essentially weak. Only a few weeks ago many on the ECB governing council seemed ‘skeptical about the need for further easing’, although some deem the ‘impact of oil’s fall on inflation as not temporary’ and wanted a bigger deposit rate cut in December, thus generating confusing signals. One thing’s for sure, if the ECB is to have serious credibility this year, there will need to be much greater control over what ECB speakers say regarding monetary policy, with likely strict  For 2016, let’s not overlook an outsider – sterling  could do well provided the Brexit vote is ‘No’  MajOR CURReNCIeS - ‘a VIew fROM The TRaDINg ROOM’ 44  instructions to stick to Draghi’s central messages.  View: Euro-bearish as we go to print, although needing to close below 1.08 to usher in a lower range. The target 12-month view suggests 1.05.  Sterling/$ (1.43) Circulating headwinds in the form of a dovish Bank of England (BoE), a ‘risk-off’ market, and Brexit-related uncertainties have seen the overall early year theme of sterling (‘Cable’) weakness remain in place. The calls for Cable to trade in the 1.30s are coming thick and fast, but beware of too many traders jumping on this gravy train, and smart buyers in the low 1.40’s proving just that, as sterling might benefit from Mr Draghi’s dovish euro rhetoric. Marginally constructive UK labour and retail sales data have also provided some brief respite and also note a measure of rate divergence with the eurozone (as BoE left rates unchanged, vs. the ECB) suggesting more monetary easing - implying euro monetary easing and even lower/more negative short rates for the euro causing sterling to firm. The recent bearish calls on sterling have been further justified as the outlook for the UK economy continues to cloud over - low inflation, disappointing industrial production, cooling wage growth – all adding to the realization that the BoE has scope to leave rates at a record low into Q1 2017 if it so chooses.  View: Currently neutral, as the dip below 1.41 has satisfied the shorts for the time being, and we would prefer to re-sell nearer 1.45. The target 12-month view centres on 1.50, probably more reflecting its historical ‘fair value’.  Yen/$ (121.21) With the yen strengthening beyond Japan’s largest manufacturers’ expectations and threatening to strengthen beyond 116, the BoJ have finally found it necessary to indicate to the market that it is closely watching FX markets, and is considering  steps to counter the impact of falling oil prices on its 2% inflation target. The dip to the lows has indeed represented short-term value (to short the yen vs. $) as we now revisit 118 and higher on firmer risk appetite. For the time being, only sustained stability - particularly in China - will see the currency pair trade back above 120. The lack of any expectation that the Bank of Japan will use additional easing (QE) means the yen could for the time being have greater staying power. However the BoJ may decide its battle against deflation is becoming more critical and threating to derail its 2% inflation target.  View: Neutral, with a preference to take profits/ go short JPY near 116. The 12-month target is for weakness vs. the dollar, at least to 123.  Conclusions From a liquidity perspective, we expect US dollar funding demand to remain high and mainly accommodated, however structural pressures are building and credit conditions will continue to tighten, spreading from the US. Meanwhile, LIBOR rates have already firmed, and going forward we think these will prove more volatile as the credit cycle begins to turn down further, as the ripple effects reach Europe.  In terms of the ‘big picture’ of the US dollar, best represented by its trade-weighted index, we keep looking for evidence of a dollar that is finally coming to the end of its long bull market, only to find it still being referred to as a ‘safe haven’ and almost obstinately staying aloft (see the chart below). On the one other hand, the ECB really does want the euro down against the other major currencies, and on the other we still expect the yen to finally one day unravel very badly of its own economic accord due to extreme government debt levels.  What happens to the renminbi is of course very pertinent to the dollar, as the Chinese have a need to improve the renminbi’s competitiveness to help exports, clearly ‘assisted’ by capital outflows, plus despite turbulence in the meantime they still want the renminbi to become a reserve currency. The confirmation of the renminbi’s ‘Special Drawing Rights’ status by the IMF puts it on that path, although the exact steps will have to be carefully managed.  So in summary, we could be on the verge of a new round of competitive currency devaluations. If the Fed are unable to ‘normalize’ rates as they  see fit, after their very late start in doing so, then - other things being equal - this could help the US Administration keep the dollar down. So which major currency is likely to do best this year? It’s a good question, and one that could prove very difficult to gauge given how the markets have traded during the early weeks of the year. Let’s not overlook an outsider! - An underdog who, so far, has managed  to remain mostly out of the limelight and headlines… - One that has taken a back-seat to Chinese equities, oil, Middle East tensions, and the ECB… - A currency whose interest rates have  historically been higher than in the US (but not currently)... - Whose interest rate curve has, historically, been steeper than its competitors (but not  currently)... - A currency which has declined 11% over the last seven months…  Maybe, just maybe, sterling could prove the winner. If the UK can brave its way through Brexit as it did the Scottish referendum (albeit with some scars) and keep its head while all those around it lose theirs, then it might well prove our winner for the year. Stranger things have happened! Of course it’s not as simple as this, but we haven’t got the time or space to take the economic case to pieces. Perhaps suffice to say that if it’s central bank credibility that is one of the key ingredients of the success or failure of monetary policy and an economy, then the Bank of England has certainly been doing a better job lately than the Federal Reserve. Lastly, in this race we are not sure how big the trophy might be!

The lack of a majority in the upper house of the parliament (the Rajya Sabha), has prevented it from bringing into reality much-awaited reforms designed to put the economy on a sustainable and high-quality growth trajectory. Having said that, the longer-term outlook for the Indian economy continues to remain robust, provided those reforms can be effected. Falling commodity prices (obviously particularly oil) have been very helpful in curbing the fiscal deficit and reigning-in inflation over the last year or so. The new government has managed to improve business confidence, for instance with activity levels starting to pick up in the infrastructure sector. Also, higher levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, totalling $20 billion for the first six months of FY2016 (compared to $14 billion in the same period in the previous year) is a sign of improvement in global investor perception.  To facilitate growth, the government launched the ‘Make in India’ campaign in September, 2014, to attract investment into the manufacturing sector. Also, the government has been making progress in addressing some of the issues related to land, labour, taxation, infrastructure policies, the encouragement of FDI, and the overall ‘Ease Of Doing Business’. Regarding the latter, this is particularly related to the investment approval process across 15 sectors, including construction, banking, defence, wholesale, retail and e-commerce.  During 2015, India remained a bright spot within major emerging markets, with real GDP growth of 7.2% during the first half of the current fiscal year, while the Indian rupee has been showing relative strength amidst much global currency (and especially emerging market FX) volatility. In FY2016, we expect GDP to grow at about 7.3%, and the rupee to remain relatively stable compared to most other emerging market currencies.  INDIa ReVISITeD 47  Falling inflation allowed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to facilitate growth by lowering interest rates by 125 bps in 2015. The Consumer Price Index has fallen by over 600 bps in the last couple of years, and forecasters see inflation remaining in a narrow band of 5-6%. This would allow the RBI to cut rates further during the current year. Lower official interest rates can only support stronger growth, however, if lenders finally start passing on the benefits of lower rates to borrowers. So far, the average base rate of nine major banks has declined by 50-60 bps, compared to a reduction of 125 bps in official policy rates. Of course growth is not so much just a function of the cost of funds, but rather a variety of factors, especially average domestic demand and purchasing power, which are in turn a function of employment, income generation, and effective government spending.  According to the recent ‘White Paper on Infrastructure Financing’, by Assocham and Crisil Ratings, India needs the equivalent of $465 billion to be spent on infrastructure development over the next five years. Prime Minister Modi has taken several important steps to help achieve this, including the faster approval process to re-invigorate investors’ interest in the sector. The share of government participation in new projects announced has increased substantially from the historical 33%, to 52% during the last 10 quarters, especially in the infrastructure sector. However, private sector capital expenditure has been low, and its involvement very half-  hearted. Elsewhere, capacity utilisation levels in the manufacturing sector have been on a downward trend, with factories operating nearly 30% below full capacity, partly due to weaker private consumption and also weaker export growth; hence private companies are not in a hurry to make new investments. Constrained by new investments, private sector growth in FY2016-17 is likely to remain modest.  There have been mixed trends in domestic consumption. While urban consumer discretionary spending is showing some signs of a pickup (for instance with firmer auto sales), rural consumption has been sluggish during the past two years. There are three main reasons attributed to this lower rural consumption: firstly, poor monsoons for two consecutive years, lowering the purchasing power of the rural population; secondly, the government’s decision to restrict increases in minimum support prices (MSPs) to keep inflation in check has capped rural income growth; and thirdly, to maintain fiscal discipline there was a reduction in overall expenditures under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGA), holding back rural recovery.  Having said all this, we do envisage domestic consumption picking up gradually, led by urban consumption, supported by a steep 24% wage hike for government employees once the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations get implemented. Lower global commodity prices should provide much-needed budgetary  support. As mentioned, central government is spear-heading capital expenditure, with a focus on roads, railways, and also defense, to spur investment demand. We expect the upcoming 2016 union budget to be pro-growth and to have a significant focus on helping rural consumption growth.  Relative to any time during the last fifty years, there is a growing sense that India has the opportunity to enjoy a period of unprecedented growth, provided required laws and reforms can be passed. The key reforms to watch for will be the Goods & Service Tax law, Land Reform Bill, Labor Reform Bill, together with reforms to revitalize the infrastructure sector. Growth in foreign exchange reserves, a lower current account deficit, and falling inflation should all provide a cushion from external factors.  Investment Conclusions There have been downgrades in estimated corporate earnings of about 15% over the last three quarters. Though earnings growth has not been evident overall during the last few years, there now appears to be greater confidence that FY2018 and beyond could see this recover towards a 20-25% per annum rate. When earnings growth resumes the Indian equity market should provide opportunities for good equity returns. Although bouts of volatility are likely, patiently holding quality Indian equities could be rewarding in the years to come, again, especially once there is tangible evidence of reforms being passed.  When earnings growth resumes, Indian Equities should provide good returns  Sensex Index over past 10 year  Source: Bloomberg  NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  35,000  30,000  25,000  20,000  15,000  10,000  5,000  0  Jan-05 Aug-05 Feb-06  Sep-06 Mar-07 Oct-07  May-08 Nov-08 Jun-09  Dec-09 Jul-10 Jan-11  Aug-11 Mar-12 Sep-12  Apr-13 Oct-13 May-14  Nov-14 Jun-15 Jan-16  SENSEX Index   egypT - aN UpDaTe egypT - aN UpDaTe  NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  48 49  EgYpT -An UpDATE  Political Parliamentary elections were held in October and November last year, culminating in the election of a parliament which held its first session in January this year. The new assembly is largely supportive of the policies introduced by the president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, helping to stabilize the political situation in the country and support the government on the ground. Successes last year included the Egypt Economic Development Conference in March (which resulted in some large financial pledges, notably in the energy sector), the issuance of a landmark Eurobond in June, and the opening of the parallel Suez Canal in August. The recent discovery of a major gas deposit could improve Egypt’s energy position, and contribute positively to the economy in the medium-term. Structural reform is ongoing.  Economic Outlook As in many oil-importing countries, growth strengthened in 2015, helped by much lower oil prices, which also allowed reductions  Successes last year included the opening of the parallel Suez Canal  in expensive fuel subsidies. We expect that rising domestic consumption led to real GDP growing acceptably by 4.0% in 2015, compared to 2.2% in 2014. The main contributors to growth last year were the manufacturing, construction, real estate and tourism sectors. In the meantime, strong investment growth has more than compensated for the negative contribution of net exports.  Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega-projects (especially in the commercial and retail real estate sectors) are expected to continue to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks and uncertainty affecting the global economy, including interest rate normalization, continued softening growth in emerging markets, and challenges facing the eurozone could pose downside risks to Egyptian GDP growth.

The annual headline CPI jumped to 11.08% in November, from 9.70% in October, so this is something to keep an eye on.  In December last year, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) central policy rates in an attempt to address ‘inflationary pressures and anchor inflation expectations’.  Real GDP growth is expected to trend towards 5% over the medium term. Reforms announced by the authorities, including in particular further reducing energy subsidies, are key, and should have a direct impact on improving the fiscal deficit over the medium-term. In the shorter-term, however, large investments are expected to increase imports and widen the current account deficit. We currently have real GDP growth penciled-in at 3% in 2016, little changed from last year, although nonetheless quite respectable, and any downward revisions to that assumption are not expected to be substantial, with  the usual proviso of there being no major adverse event.  In 2017, Egypt’s economy is expected to register economic growth in excess of 4.5% up from 3% in 2016. Such a boost in growth is likely to be a result of structural & fiscal reforms, such as removal of subsidies, minimal interference to currency (to reduce pressure on foreign reserves), increasing tax revenues, and also a jump in tourist numbers. Egypt has been facing mounting pressure to devalue its currency, rather than rationing dollars and keeping its pound artificially strong. In its latest FX auction, the central bank kept the Egyptian pound steady, at 7.73 to the dollar. The contraction in foreign currency inflows accompanying the recent adverse news affecting the Egyptian tourism sector exacerbated the foreign currency shortage. An improvement in security would help with restoring foreign currency inflows. Egypt clearly has various significant tourist attractions, and although from time to time there are security breaches the tourists almost inevitably return.   aSSeT allOCaTION - whaT IT ShOUlD MeaN fOR pRIVaTe INVeSTORS aSSeT allOCaTION - whaT IT ShOUlD MeaN fOR pRIVaTe INVeSTORS  NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016 NBAD GloBAl INvestmeNt outlook for 2016  50 51  Sources: Bloomberg; Using monthly returns from January 1991 to January 2016.

ASSET AlloCATIon - whAT IT ShoUlD MEAn foR pRIVATE InVESToRS The term ‘Asset Allocation’ remains a popular ‘buzzword’ in investment circles, yet it is possible that some clients may not understand its importance in practice. A well-constructed asset allocation plan can both lower portfolio volatility and limit downside risk. Studies indicate that up to 90% of investment portfolio returns will be determined by asset allocation. That makes asset allocation – by asset class (i.e. bonds, equities, alternative investments including hedge funds, commodities, real estate and cash) more important than which specific investments are chosen for diversification purposes. Clients must realize how important their asset allocation plan is and spend quality time with their Advisors doing it correctly.  The selection of investment vehicles depends on each individual’s situation and needs. It also depends on each investor’s attitude towards risk, that is risks he/ she is willing to accept and their ability to tolerate that risk. In his book, ‘A Random Walk Down Wall Street’, Burton G. Malkiel (2004) stated, “The risks you can afford to take depend on your total financial situation, including the types and sources of your income exclusive of your investment income”.  There are other factors such as investment-timeframe (short-term and long-term), liquidity needs and investor-specific constraints, which should be considered while making an asset allocation decision. There are other factors such as age, job stability, income level and its volatility, and the industry in which an investor works are all important to consider prior to making an asset allocation decision.  Since younger investors have a longer time to work and accumulate wealth, they have greater capacity to invest in risky assets.  A relatively young investor has a longer time to recoup losses in the case of a prolonged bear market or poor entry point. By comparison, an investor who is close to retirement, whose earning capacity from employment is coming to an end, should become more conservative in investment policy, and emphasize regular income over capital gains. Despite the information received often being good, investors should be careful about investing too heavily in the stocks of the industry in which they are employed. For example, employees working for information technology companies should not become too enthusiastic about investing in stocks of companies in the same industry, as both portfolio returns and salary to  greater or lesser degree will be driven by the performance of the industry. Any downturn in the industry will not only adversely impact one’s salary level (or existence), but also portfolio returns.  Investors typically consider just stocks and bonds when thinking of their portfolios, yet this is rather old-fashioned. Just the other day we received a circular from a major investment bank containing a table detailing that ‘neutral’ weightings in equities would be 65%, bonds would be 35%, and cash 5%, making 100% - but  Correlation Matrix  Asset Classes  equities  Bonds  Cash  Properties  Commodities  Hedge funds  Calculated for period Dec 2010 - Dec 2015  Equities  1.00  0.35  -0.14  0.77  0.40  0.63  Bonds  1.00  -0.39  0.50  0.24  0.43  Cash     1.00  -0.13  -0.07  -0.16  Properties       1.00  0.38  0.47  Commodities         1.00  0.48  Hedge Fund         1.00  what about the other asset classes, we wondered? Other assets classes such as real estate, alternative investments such as hedge fund investments, and precious metals should also be considered in asset allocation decisions. Studies suggest that the correlation between real estate and bonds and stocks is quite low, and hence real estate (over-and-above the homes we own to live in, which should arguably be sidelined in such a discussion) can be an excellent diversifier. Carefully selected, residential and/or commercial real estate can produce regular cash flow from rental income.  Events such as death, disability or disease can devastate the income of a family, and severely compromise the ability to cover even basic regular liabilities. Hence, the importance of purchasing adequate insurance coverage must be emphasized, and this is especially true if future financial obligations are high. Decisions regarding insurance of all kinds should be made in conjunction with the overall asset allocation framework designed in conjunction with a client’s Advisor. Often for cultural reasons here in the Middle East, insurance coverage tends not to be considered in the way in which it is in the more fully developed world. There are tentative signs that this may be changing, however, and we very much welcome it.  Lastly, it is also worth mentioning that every investor should maintain a cash ‘buffer’, ideally six months to a year’s income equivalent, easily accessible in the case of any unforeseen event.

Investors who start investing early, practice patience, and who adhere to a long-term investing strategy - advised by experts if they lack the necessary skills themselves - tend to generate the best returns. Investing is not only about how much money you have; it’s also about how much  time you have!  linked to the idea of time and in the words of Albert einstein, “compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world; he who understands it, earns it…, he who doesn’t… pays it”. successful investors are aware of the power of compound interest, and use it to their best advantage over a period of years. Whether the interest is composed of dividends from stocks (which of course can grow over time, further boosting capital valuations), or is received as coupon payments from bonds, such income is a significant contributor to total returns over long periods. t o maximize this, investors must start investing early in their careers and aim to do so on a regular basis, as the power of compounding accelerates steeply over time.  Always fully understand why a particular investment is being made. Don’t forget to thoroughly research an idea before investing in order to reach an informed decision. take an expert’s advice. Never invest on the basis of a ‘hot tip’, which amounts to gambling.  Dollar-cost averaging - also known as the ‘constant dollar plan’ - requires an investor to commit a fixed amount of funds to stocks or mutual funds at specific intervals, monthly, quarterly, or whatever period is most suitable for a given savings scheme. Dollar-cost averaging results in buying fewer shares when the price is higher, and more when the price is lower. over time, this has the effect of lowering the average price paid for whichever asset is being accumulated, compared to the timing and monetary risks inherent in establishing the position in one go.  A trailing stop-loss is a set percentage below the purchase price, which if hit, triggers an automatic sell (i.e. ‘stop-loss’). We all have a tendency to hold an investment which begins to go wrong, and while there may be times when a price will hit a ‘stop’ that leads to a sale before the price then recovers, cutting the loss is usually the best thing to do. When a stop is hit, that is the market telling the investor they are wrong.  If the price goes up, the stop level should be moved up in line with it. When the price stops going up, the stop loss price remains at the level it was dragged up to. this simple but effective methodology is a way of automatically protecting a profit, and is an excellent method to apply when investors lack the discipline of cutting losses.  By following the simple rules of investment above, your portfolios are likely to generate higher and better quality returns, and the level of stress involved will be far lower. for instance, thinking back to dollar-cost averaging on a four or five year view, although towards the end of the period it would obviously be better if those markets had gone up, in the early years it would actually be better if the markets fell! How cool is that?  the reason to hold a diversified portfolio is to spread the risk across multiple asset classes to protect against market volatility in any single asset class. Although it doesn’t ensure a profit, sufficient diversification provides the potential for a smoother ride. Your Advisor will do their best to ensure that the individual segments of your portfolio are not too  correlated with each other, and/or that sufficient amounts of uncorrelated asset classes (typically vs. the s&P500) are present to dampen overall volatility. If an investment doubles, there is a good case for selling half the position, even if it still looks fine in terms of valuation and prospects, as the effective cost of the half that  remains in the portfolio will fall to zero!  once properly set up in accordance with the dictates of the mandate, portfolios should only need periodic ‘tweaking’, rather than overhauls (which less-experienced investors often resort to during periods of market volatility or losses). Although sometimes more easily said than done, investors must try to minimize the impact of emotion on their investments, possibly leading to selling at the bottom, or buying close to the peak. Instead, it is usually prudent to stay invested in quality assets over the long haul.

Bars A traditional way of investing in gold is via gold bars. In countries, like Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, they can be bought or sold at major banks and/ or bullion dealers. Bars come in various sizes. In Europe, ‘Good Delivery’ bars are approximately 400 oz (12 kg). Bars generally carry lower price premiums than gold coins. Buyers of bars are often advised to have them re-assayed to establish their authenticity. There can still be problems with the larger bars, as they have a greater volume, with space to facilitate forgery via a tungsten-filled cavity, possibly not shown by an assay. As with coins, especially in quantity, storing and insuring physical gold, and the associated dealing costs can become a drag on the investment, especially for high net worth individuals who have decided to establish an overweight position.  Coins Gold coins can easily be weighed and measured to establish authenticity. They are a popular way of owning gold, priced according to their ‘fine weight’, plus a small premium based on market conditions. Like buying bullion, gold coins represent direct exposure to the physical asset that is gold. Many investors in gold want to be able to touch it, rather than just store it in a safe deposit box. Such investors should buy small bars or coins. The most popular gold coin globally is the Krugerrand, which can be bought in large quantities, and generally costs a bit less than its  competitors.  and do not necessarily guarantee an equal exchange for physical metal in the event of a run on the holding bank. Allocated gold certificates, however, are linked to specific numbered bars. Various types of gold accounts are available, with varying intermediation between the owners and the metal. As above, it is important to know whether the gold is allocated, or unallocated. Bullion dealers usually only deal in quantities of 1000 ozs or more, on either an allocated, or unallocated basis.  Futures, options and other derivatives Investors don’t have to use leverage in futures, although most do. Many other derivatives exist, such as gold forwards, options, CFDs and spread betting. High net worth individuals investors or institutions can deal directly in the over-the-counter (OTC) market.  ETFs ETFs are legally classified as open-ended investment companies. The best-known gold ETF is the SPDR Gold Trust. ETFs are an easy way to gain exposure to gold, without the inconvenience of storing physical bars. However investors should be aware that ETF and similar instruments, even if backed by physical gold for the benefit of the investor, may carry counterparty risks associated with the investment vehicle itself.  Gold mining equities/funds Investors can buy shares in the companies that produce the gold, from relatively blue-chip, established producers, to junior exploration plays. Gold producers can give the investor operational gearing via increasing profit margins if the gold price rises; also, if the gold price rises, so will the in situ value of ore reserves  held by the company, and that should also be reflected in the stock price. However, mines carry geological and structural risks, as well as management risk, and often political risk. A good investment vehicle could be a mutual fund or investment trust investing in professionally managed portfolios of gold mining companies, thus spreading the risk.  Gold certificates & accounts Gold certificates allow investors to avoid the costs and risks associated with the transfer and storage of physical metal, such as theft, assay costs, and bid/offer spreads. There are, however, different risks and costs  related to them (storage  fees, commissions, and credit risk). Gold certificates may be backed by gold which is ‘allocated’ (fully reserved), or ‘unallocated’ (pooled). Unallocated gold certificates are an example of fractional reserve banking,  There are vehicles to choose from to suit every  gold investor   Clint Dove Anisha Makani Abhishek Shukla Alain Markus Alison Higgins Alp Eke Anne de Terssac Craig Tredgett Danay Sarypbekov Darpan Sugandh Eyad Moustafa Glenn Wepener Ian Clarke Nourah AlZahmi Paul Bearman Phil Muldoon Rameshwar Tiwary Sagar Patel Sajeer Babu Shaikha AlZaabi  Special thanks to:  Adib Daccache Ahmed Mamdouh Avinash Menon Chavan Bhogaita Chris Wray Luis Tomassoni Musa Haddad Omeir Jilani Saleem Khokhar Sanaa Al Ketbi Sherif Metwally Shiraz Habib  ConTRIBUToRS  CONTRIBUTORS 56 57 DISCLAIMER  Disclaimer: This document has been prepared and issued by the Global Asset Management (GAM) of the National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (“NBAD”) outlining particular services provided by GAM and does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to sell, or any solicitation of any offer to purchase or subscribe for, any shares in NBAD or otherwise or a recommendation for a particular person to enter into any transaction or to adopt any strategy nor shall it or any part of it form the basis of or be relied on in connection with any contract therefore.

Rural economic development holds the key to ensuring that the nutritional needs of a growing global population are met, and poverty in rural areas is eased, narrowing the gaps between rural and urban populations. By promoting rural development, governments not only have signifi cant scope to unlock economic growth, they also have the potential to change fundamentally the structure of the economy.  Yet, a number of obstacles stand in the way of stronger rural economic growth. In this report, our focus on six nations—Angola, Argentina, China, France, India and Nigeria—highlights some of these key barriers:   Policy. A lack of focus on rural development is exacerbated by the absence of political will, weak rule of law and poor enforcement of rural policy.   Land rights. Restrictions on land use or land rights and lack of adequate land documentation result in signifi cant underinvestment in the agricultural sector.   Operational infrastructure. Transportation, power and water infrastructure are often lacking;  Executive summary  investment is needed in rural supply chains, productivity improvements, roads and irrigation.   Social infrastructure. Investment in healthcare and education, as well as in broadband Internet and mobile-communication networks is needed to make rural areas more attractive.  To probe the untapped potential of the world’s rural economies, we modelled how GDP, rural GDP and rural populations evolve up to 2030, according to three scenarios:  1. A scenario extrapolated from our baseline long-term forecast.  2. A scenario in which rural growth is unleashed as policymakers around the globe implement measures to stimulate rural development, following a hard landing in China.  3. A scenario that assumes a gradual decline in rural economies’ contribution to GDP growth.  This long-term forecasting model includes variables ranging from trade to population growth at country level. In turn, these variables produced output data in three key areas: GDP, rural GDP and rural population. We then produced country-specifi c forecasts under each of the three scenarios, forming the forecast basis of this research.   3 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2015  Unleashing rural economies  Policymakers have tended to overlook rural development as a critical part of overall economic and social wellbeing. Yet, the importance of rural economies is intensifying as the world faces signifi cant challenges in meeting the nutritional needs of a growing human population. Today, hunger persists in many developing economies as food prices hit the poorest members of society hardest. Looking ahead, as the world’s population grows to at least 7.6bn by 2030, concerns around food security are likely to intensify.  At the same time, rural areas have a critical role to play in the fi ght against poverty. While much progress has been made in improving living standards across the globe, it is in the world’s rural areas that many of the world’s areas of extreme poverty are to be found. Around 1.4bn people live on less than US$1.25 a day, more than two-thirds of these in rural areas of developing countries. Promoting sustainable growth in rural areas is not only a means by which to improve food security and bolster economic performance, but is also an important tool with which to eradicate extreme poverty.  Crucially, rural areas offer potential for untapped economic growth. In this, the importance of the rural economy extends beyond agriculture: ancillary industries that support or service farming also have a critical role to play in rural development, including food processing,  Introduction  packaging and logistics. Food production aside, leisure and tourism are among the sectors increasingly underpinning rural economic development; there is scope, too, for growth in education, healthcare and other services that improve quality of life in rural areas.  To be sure, the multiplier effect at play in rural economies (see below) means that, as policymakers foster conditions that promote economic development in rural areas, demand for products and services in rural territories will expand—providing opportunities for new economic activities to take root in these areas. In turn, this rural economic development has the potential to support a convergence of economic prosperity in rural and urban areas—effectively reducing income disparities between rural and urban dwellers and bringing rural living standards into line with those in urban areas.  In 2013 rural areas accounted for 16.2% of global economic output—making them a key source of economic activity. In addition to productivity gains in agriculture and other rural activities already seen, there remains considerable scope for growth in rural output. Our estimates indicate that unlocking rural growth could see hundreds of billions of dollars of additional output by 2030, with rural economies accounting for an increased share of world economic output and raising overall economic-growth rates.   4 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2015  Unleashing rural economies  We need to understand that rural development is part of the general economic and social development of any given country  Eugenia Serova of the Rural Infrastructure and Agro-Industries Division of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN  The focus of this research project is a better understanding of the macro- and microeconomic conditions that would enable rural economies to deliver a more signifi cant contribution to economic growth. To do so, The Economist Intelligence Unit has undertaken extensive economic modelling, based on a number of scenarios. We asked nine expert panellists to identify the major forces that will infl uence the future prospects of rural economies. They identifi ed the trends that they considered to be most important in political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental areas, with a 2030 time horizon. From there, we developed a range of inputs that would differ across the various scenarios. At the heart of these is the baseline scenario, characterised by a continuation of the status quo and extrapolated from our in-house long-term economic forecast.  We also selected two further scenarios that our panellists developed, as follows:  A) An “unleashing” of the rural economy, which results in an increased contribution of the rural economy to overall economic growth. This scenario is driven by a series of events and their consequences:   A “hard landing” in China’s economy, causing a global downturn and a reorientation towards  About The Economist Intelligence Unit’s model  Clearly, rural development offers signifi cant opportunity. To best tap that opportunity, says Eugenia Serova, director of the Rural Infrastructure and Agro-Industries Division of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN, policymakers must adopt a holistic approach to rural development. She points out that the  rural economy is inextricably linked to the wider economy—and to political, cultural and social issues. “We need to understand that rural development is part of the general economic and social development of any given country,” Ms Serova notes.  currently neglected areas of growth, in particular using rural development as a means of raising incomes and reducing poverty.   In this scenario, many developing countries are hit by the marked decline in demand for raw materials and there are risks of signifi cantly increased social unrest, particularly across large swathes of rural regions.   Weaker economic growth, coupled with civil unrest, is projected to trigger a government response, stimulating growth in rural areas in order to reduce rural poverty and rebalance development opportunities.  Several other scenarios not represented in the modelling fi gures are also able to deliver growth and reforms in line with the forecast above. Prominent among these is a scenario of incremental improvements without a specifi c trigger, or a switch towards a greener, more broadly sustainable growth trajectory, in China in particular. The key to this scenario is undertaking reform in order to align the correct macro- and microeconomic forces to unleash stronger development.  B) In the interest of scope and balance, we also modelled an incremental decline in the contribution of the rural economy to global economic growth that is driven by the following forces:   5 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2015  Unleashing rural economies  Rural GDP, real (2005 prices; US$ bn)  World  Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit.  8,000  9,000  10,000  11,000  12,000  13,000  14,000  15,000  16,000  17,000  18,000  8,000  9,000  10,000  11,000  12,000  13,000  14,000  15,000  16,000  17,000  18,000  Incremental decline scenario: World Baseline scenario: World Unleashing scenario: World  2030 2029 2028 2027 2026 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013  Table 1: Global real GDP, rural GDP and rural population forecast 2030, by scenario  2013  2030—“unleashing” scenario 2030—baseline scenario 2030—“decline” scenario  Global real GDP growth % 2.6 3.3 3.2 3.2  Global rural GDP growth % 1.3 3.7 2.3 1.6  Global rural GDP as a % of total 16.2 17.6 15.2 14.3  Global rural population as a % of total 45.2 45.4 37.3 36.6  Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit.   Agricultural subsidies, still classed as non-distortionary by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), trigger a protectionist spiral in agricultural trade.   Agriculture profi tability in developing countries falls, hampered by comparatively slow technological development and high input prices. Foreign investment stalls and the sector stagnates.   The industrial export-led growth model prevails in much of Asia and Latin America, serving as a blueprint for other developing countries, despite the cost of energy imports and supply-chain constraints.  We developed a customised version of our long-term forecasting model, integrating additional  output data specifi c to rural economies. This means not only agricultural growth, but also applies a multiplier effect, capturing rural growth in other adjacent sectors. Key supply-side drivers that were used as input variables for this long-term model include factors around institutional quality (for example, rule of law, quality of bureaucracy, or protection of property rights) and around government regulation (for example, price controls, restrictiveness of labour laws or freedom to compete against others). In simulating these three scenarios in our model, we adjusted forecasts of the supply-side drivers that were used as input variables.  The key output of this long-term forecasting model is GDP, which is used to drive other variables, ranging from trade to population   6 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2015  Unleashing rural economies  The fi ndings of this report indicate the existence of an alternative long-term path for rural development.  growth. We focused the analysis on output data in three key areas: GDP, rural GDP and rural population. Based on the three scenarios, we then produced country-specifi c forecasts, as well as global aggregates (see Table 1). Under the “unleashing” scenario, for example, rural GDP growth will be 3.7% in 2030, markedly higher than the 2.3% forecast under the baseline scenario.  Under the unleashing scenario, reforms aimed at stimulating rural development bolster rural economic growth markedly from 2019 (see Chart 1). The long time horizon needed to surpass the current growth trajectory is partly a construction of the particular scenario employed; a less severe trigger for reform than a hard landing in China could open up substantial growth prospects, without a medium-term dip in growth. However, this also refl ects the need to undergo substantial reform and investment to realise improved long-term growth potential.  While it is unlikely that policymakers across the globe will spontaneously take co-ordinated action to stimulate rural development, leading to the economic-development forecast in the chart above, the output of our model clearly demonstrates the untapped potential in rural  economies. Under the right conditions, these rural economies have the potential to be much larger in absolute terms and to make a greater relative contribution to the wider economy by 2030. As such, the fi ndings of this report indicate the existence of an alternative long-term path for rural development.  We selected the six countries profi led in this report—Angola, Argentina, China, France, India and Nigeria—for the broad range of geographic and economic profi les that they represent. These nations illustrate the variety of challenges that countries across the globe face as they seek to unlock rural economic growth, and serve to provide some sense of the scale of extra growth that can be unlocked by other nations around the world.  A hard landing in China is just one of several events or triggers that could lead to an upturn in rural economic growth. Naturally, policymakers in many countries across the world have the tools at their disposal to progress—to whatever extent—towards any of the outcomes presented here, regardless of exogenous factors. This research provides a glimpse of the rural economic growth that it may be possible for policymakers to unlock, if they are committed to doing so.   7 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2015  Unleashing rural economies  The Economist Intelligence Unit would like to thank the following individuals (listed alphabetically by organisation name) for sharing their insights and expertise during the research for this paper:   Louis-Pascal Mahé, professor emeritus, Agrocampus Ouest, France   Luc Rigouzzo, managing partner and executive president, Amethis Finance, France   Albert Keidel, senior fellow, Atlantic Council, US   Jikun Huang, Founder and Director, Centre for Agricultural Policy, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China   Lucio Castro, director of economic development, Centre for the Implementation of Public Policies Promoting Equity and Growth, Argentina   Steven Kyle, associate professor, Department of Applied Economics and Management, Cornell University, US   Kolawole Adebayo, professor of rural development communication, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria   Eugenia Serova, director, Rural Infrastructure and Agro-Industries Division, Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN, Italy   Robin Bourgeois, senior foresight and development policies expert, Global Forum on  Agricultural Research, Italy   Horacio Busanello, CEO, Grupo Los Grobo, Argentina   Cherian Thomas, CEO, IDFC Foundation, India   Claus Reiner, country programme manager for Argentina, International Fund for Agricultural Development, Italy   Gao Yu, country director, Landesa, China   Srikumar Misra, founder and CEO, Milk Mantra, India   François Houllier, president and CEO, National Institute for Agricultural Research, France   Hervé Guyomard, economist, National Institute for Agricultural Research, France   M V Rao, director-general, National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, India   Hans Jöhr, corporate head of agriculture, Nestlé, Switzerland   Louw Burger, managing director, Thai Farm International, Nigeria   James Oehmke, senior food security and nutrition advisor, Bureau for Food Security, USAID, US   Philippe Scholtès, director, Agribusiness Development Branch, UN Industrial Development Organisation, Austria  Acknowledgements   8 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2015  Unleashing rural economies  Angola 1  Angola’s oil industry accounts for over 46% of the country’s GDP and 95% of its export revenue; understandably, this has created some imbalances in the economy. In coastal cities, oil drives what is almost an enclave economy: the strength of the Angolan currency, the kwanza, enables cities to source food cheaply via imports, rather than from Angola’s rural areas. The rural economy makes up 24.1% of Angola’s total real GDP, even though its rural population of 9m accounts for around 42% of the country’s total 21.5m inhabitants. This makes for a sharp divide in quality of life and economic-development prospects between rural and urban residents.  By the time the country emerged from decades of confl ict, in 2002, much of its physical infrastructure had been destroyed. Moreover, socio-demographic challenges abound. Almost 4m people, one-third of Angola’s population, were obliged to leave their homes; in many cases, rural skills have not been passed on to the next generation as a result of this dislocation. And rural regions continue to face shortages of livestock and other key agricultural inputs.  Neverthless, Angola’s rural economies hold remarkable promise. “Agriculture can thrive there,” says Steven Kyle, an associate professor at Cornell University. “Angola has the potential to have a strong agricultural sector, which satisfi es national needs and can export the surplus.” He points out that the country has some of the best natural resources in southern Africa in terms of soil, climate and water conditions. “It would be possible to develop the country and have the urban demand centres supplied from the domestic farm sector,” Mr Kyle suggests.  Yet, political will is absent, at least in part because oil is higher than rural development on the list of policymakers’ priorities. “For all the government occasionally implies to the contrary, agriculture does not get a lot of money,” says Mr Kyle. “The ruling Mouvement populaire de libération de l’Angola (MPLA) are okay with people trying to develop agriculture, but, for the people in charge, that is not where their money comes from—it comes from oil. Their focus is not there; that is not part of their life or their future.”  Furthermore, if Angola’s rural economy is to fulfi l its potential, policymakers must also strengthen the rule of law. Angola places 141st in a ranking of 144 countries, based on ethics and corruption, which forms part of the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index. Much of Angola’s economy is subject to arbitrary or unfair decisions by offi cials, according to Mr Kyle: “If you are a peasant out in the countryside, you are at the mercy of any petty offi cial at the intersection who wants to tax you or just steal stuff outright.”  A further issue is basic infrastructure. There is a need for policymakers to address shortfalls in basic transportation infrastructure, enabling more effi cient movement of farm produce to markets. In Angola’s poorer rural areas, much of the population are subsistence farmers that remain disconnected from the wider economy, in part because of the lack of a road network. “From a physical point of view, roads and bridges have been destroyed, and, as yet, some have not been rebuilt,” says Mr Kyle.  Angola has the potential to have a strong agricultural sector, which satisfi es national needs and can export the surplus.  Steven Kyle, Professor at Cornell University   9 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2015  Unleashing rural economies  According to The Economist Intelligence Unit’s “unleashing” scenario, a hard landing in China has an important impact on Angolan oil exports, leaving the government struggling to maintain revenue over the forecast period. As part of economic reforms, the agricultural sector becomes a government priority. Our economic model assumes that corruption is curbed, the rule of law better enforced, and governance and  regulation improved during the forecast period. This applies both to the rural economy and the broader economy, but opens up substantial growth opportunities for rural development, specifi cally.

GDP growth reaches 10% in 2030 in the unleashing scenario, signifi cantly higher than the 7.2% growth under the baseline scenario. Rural GDP has the scope to grow to US$78.3bn by 2030— generating fully US$46.6bn of additional annual production over and above the baseline scenario of US$31.7bn (see Table 2).  Furthermore, under the unleashing scenario, the structure of Angola’s total economy shifts signifi cantly: it is clear that agriculture has the  potential to become a signifi cant driver of the country’s economy, with rural GDP accounting for 44.7% of the total US$175bn GDP by 2030 and driving total output US$2bn higher, despite China’s woes.  With better transportation links in rural areas and improved economic prospects for rural economies, sections of Angola’s urban population gradually return to rural areas in search of new opportunities, leading to a rise in the rural population to 43.8% of the total 34.8m by 2030; our baseline scenario foresees a rise to 39.6%.

While agriculture accounts for over half of Argentina’s foreign-exchange revenue, it employs a relatively low proportion of the workforce. At the same time, the rural population of 3m accounts for just 7.1% of the country’s total 41.7m population.  Yet, since Argentina’s economic crisis of 2001–02, economic mismanagement and interference by successive governments has eroded the country’s competitive advantage in agriculture. Poorly conceived policies have left the rural economy, as well as the wider economy, signifi cantly weakened and have led to high-infl ation, low-growth conditions. Nevertheless, there is signifi cant scope for Argentina’s rural economy to regain its competitive advantage and to strengthen its contribution to the country’s overall economic health.  Indeed, it is this economic mismanagement that is one of the biggest challenges that policymakers must tackle to unlock growth in Argentina’s rural economy. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2014–2015, Argentina’s macroeconomic environment ranks just 102nd of 144 countries. The strong devaluation of the Argentinian peso may have made exports more competitive, yet export taxes, quotas and exchange-rate controls that hamper trade must be eased. Similarly,  Argentina 2  government restrictions on imports that limit the agricultural sector’s access to capital goods and other technologies must be lifted.  Another challenge lies in the form of trade restrictions imposed by the government in the wake of the 2001–02 economic crisis, which weigh heavily on Argentina’s rural economy. Not least among these is the quota system for cereal exports known as the registro de exportación. With elections due in October 2015, some experts hope a new government will lift trade restrictions. Yet, in the short term, this may be diffi cult to achieve without further fuelling infl ation and worsening state fi nances, argues Mr Castro. However, he hopes that reforms will, in time, enable the lifting of such trade restrictions.  A further issue is taxes. “We need to address the fi scal burden on agricultural activity that erodes farmers’ profi tability,” says Horacio Busanello, CEO of Argentinian agribusiness company, Grupo Los Grobo. “It is not only about export duties, but also the combination of national, provincial and county taxes.” By easing restrictions that are holding back the agricultural sector, he believes, crop production can be increased by 50% by 2020. Increasing yearly exports in line with higher production could generate additional revenue of around US$10bn annually for Argentina, according to Mr Busanello.  Logistics costs are a further burden on Argentina’s rural economy; 80% of Argentina’s agricultural produce is transported by road, yet logistics costs are increasing at a double-digit percentage rate due to rising wage costs, higher fuel prices, and underinvestment in roads. At  Most of the sector uses advanced technology and most of it is close to international [standards] in terms of productivity  Lucio Castro director of the Centre for the Implementation of Public Policies Promoting Equity and Growth   12 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2015  Unleashing rural economies  the same time, 70% of total agricultural exports go through a single port, Rosario Port, posing a strategic risk for Argentina’s economy. Unless Argentina invests a further 1–2% of GDP in transportation infrastructure, highlights Mr Castro, the agricultural sector will struggle to increase exports.  The Economist Intelligence Unit’s “unleashing” scenario forecasts that a hard landing in the Chinese economy hits prices of Argentina’s agricultural exports and the subsequent deterioration in the balance of payments causes macroeconomic diffi culties. In 2013 Argentina’s exports to China amounted to US$5.5bn, or 7.2% of all its exports, according to International Trade Centre (ITC) data; of those exports to China, around US$4.3bn, or 78%, were agricultural exports.  However, should policymakers embrace structural reforms in an effort to trigger growth, there is ample scope for increased economic activity—in particular, the upside potential from Argentina’s agricultural resources is substantial. Accordingly, among the input factors we have adjusted for in our economic model are the effects of a gradual easing of price controls and a lifting of market distortions.  While the China hard landing causes Argentina’s real GDP growth to slow, bottoming out at 2.2% in 2018, the subsequent rebound, fuelled by renewed competitiveness of the country’s agricultural sector and stronger exports, sees real GDP growth outstrip growth under the baseline scenario in 2024 (see Chart 3). Real GDP growth in 2030, for example, is 4% in the unleashing scenario, signifi cantly above the 3% under the baseline scenario.  In the unleashing scenario, Argentina’s rural GDP expands to US$147bn by 2030, accounting for 26.5% of the total US$555.1bn GDP at that time, and representing a full US$33bn of annual additional productivity in Argentina’s rural areas over and above our 2030 baseline scenario (see Table 3).  Moreover, additional productivity and income in rural areas bolsters rural populations to 4.4m, or 9.3% of the total 47.2m population by 2030. In the baseline scenario, the rural population accounts for just 2m, or 4.2% of the total, by 2030, refl ecting a signifi cant depletion of human capital in rural areas as agricultural-employment opportunities stagnate.

Stressing the linkage of urban and rural areas, China has invested considerable resources in transportation networks; this helps connect its 739.8m rural population, which accounts for 54.8% of the total 1.35bn.  While developed coastal areas have been growing faster than rural inland regions, as Albert Keidel, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in the US, points out, family incomes in these inland regions have nevertheless been expanding at between 6% and 9% annually. “Income disparities between the coastal regions and the interior are overshadowed by the speed with which the standards of living have improved everywhere,” he explains.  However, a signifi cant issue in rural development in China is property development. Local governments that generate income through land sales are fuelling China’s real-estate boom— driving up indebtedness and increasing the risk of a hard landing. Illegal conversion of land use reduces arable land available for crops and leads to land being taken from farmers. Farmers are granted 30-year land-use rights, but the law provides for expropriation in the public interest.  China 3  Land expropriation has been on the rise, but is often not in line with regulation, according to Gao Yu, country director at Landesa in China. Farmers rarely receive adequate compensation.  Underinvestment in agriculture is one consequence. “Farmers don’t invest enough in land because they have concerns that their land could be taken in the next months or next years,” says Mr Gao. This reluctance to invest more is also clear among farmers who do not have adequate documentation for their land, which adds to insecurity. “If farmers receive proper land certifi cates, they are 77% more likely to make mid- and long-term investments in land than those with non-compliant ones,” Mr Gao adds, citing a survey published in 2012 by Landesa.  In tackling rural property development, according to Mr Gao, the fi rst priority is to regulate land expropriations and defi ne “public interest” more clearly, in order to minimise abuse. Furthermore, compensation levels need to be brought into line with market valuations. Farmers’ rights in contesting expropriation ought to be more clearly laid out and existing laws enforced. Already, in October 2014, China’s agriculture minister had announced land reforms aimed at promoting agricultural competitiveness; he warned against “forcing land transfers against farmers’ will, which violates their rights”.  China’s grain self-suffi ciency policy is a further issue holding back its rural economy. Many farmers are required to allocate land to low-margin grain—just as growing prosperity and urbanisation drive demand for higher-quality foods. “A lot of farmers are earning less money  Farmers don’t invest enough in land because they have concerns that their land could be taken in the next months or next years  Gao Yu, country director at Landesa in China   15  © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2015  Unleashing rural economies  than they could if they put their land into vegetables and fruit,” says Mr Keidel.  According to The Economist Intelligence Unit’s rural “unleashing” scenario, the economic pain associated with the hard landing in China destabilises the one-party state, leading policymakers to stall in pushing through reforms needed to promote rural development. As output  from other sectors of the economy declines in the short term, agriculture remains somewhat resilient; given effective reform in the middle of our forecast period, rural economic growth rebounds.

Despite the initial hard landing that shifts the development trajectory, real GDP growth reaches 5% in 2030 under the unleashing scenario, and appears on an upward trend; by contrast, under the baseline scenario, growth is static, at 4% from 2023 to the end of the forecast period.  China’s rural GDP has the potential to expand to US$2.2trn by 2030, representing additional annual productivity of fully US$127.9bn beyond  our baseline scenario, which foresees rural GDP of US$2.1trn in 2030 (see Table 4). In our unleashing scenario, rural GDP accounts for 23.5% of China’s total US$9.3trn GDP by 2030, signifi cantly higher than the 19.6% of total GDP under our baseline scenario.  According to our unleashing scenario, a hard landing in China would also likely lead to a signifi cant slowdown in urbanisation, as employment opportunities in cities dwindle and internal migrants return from cities to rural areas. Under this scenario, we forecast that China’s rural population accounts for 53.7% of the 1.4bn total by 2030, signifi cantly above the baseline assumption of 39%.

By most measures, France’s agricultural sector is strong—but there remains considerable scope to unlock further growth in its rural economy.  Over the past four decades, some migration patterns have shifted. Some city-dwellers who move to rural areas may be escaping the high cost of living in urban centres or seeking a better quality of life. Today, France’s rural population of 14.3m accounts for 22.3% of the country’s 64.3m total population. Productivity improvements in agricultural have led to declining employment in the sector across France’s rural areas, while services, including tourism and leisure, account for a growing proportion of job creation.  Indeed, opportunities for the further development of France’s rural economy lie principally in sectors other than agriculture. François Houllier, president and CEO of the Institut national de la récherche agronomique (INRA, French National Institute for Agricultural Research) points out that a shift has occurred in recent decades, as France’s rural economy has evolved: “Job creation mainly occurs in public and private services, in the tertiary sector, and especially with regard to services that are offered to the residents, be they tourists or local residents,” he says. This shift serves to emphasise the importance of multiplier effects in France’s rural economies, especially in tourism and leisure.  One obstacle to the development of the rural economy is France’s application of the EU Common Agricultural Policy, according to experts. The policy comprises two pillars: income support and rural development. Hervé Guyomard, an economist with INRA, points out that France’s application is insuffi ciently based on an integrated approach to rural development. “There is an excessive focus on agricultural activities, when you compare how other countries like Germany, Austria, or the UK use the second pillar,” he says. As such, France may be neglecting potentially benefi cial initiatives, such as boosting innovation, promoting economic diversifi cation and improving the quality of life in rural areas.  Louis-Pascal Mahé, professor emeritus at Agrocampus Ouest in France, advocates adopting a territorial approach to policy, rather than a sector-based approach, making regional-development efforts more effective. An emphasis on the diversity of activities involved in rural economies would strengthen multiplier effects present in rural growth, he argues. “It would be better to focus on the rural areas that are in trouble, instead of spreading the agricultural funds all over France, much of it to those who are already well-off,” he says. However, a change of approach risks leaving some farmers with excessive cuts in funds, as Professor Guyomard points out. Nevertheless, while this may be politically diffi cult, signifi cant progress in rural development could follow.  An increasing challenge is seasonality, as rural employment shifts from agriculture to services,  France 4   18 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2015  Unleashing rural economies  including leisure and tourism. When agricultural activity—by its nature seasonal—was a stronger component of rural economies, local inhabitants remained present in rural areas year-round and organised their lives according to the cycle of the seasons. By contrast, the growth of seasonal activities such as leisure and tourism, with their sporadic labour needs, may mean that employers  are reluctant to invest in training and that rural areas struggle to retain skills and experience. The issue is complicated further, Mr Guyomard says, by France’s labour legislation.  A third issue is provision of services in remote areas of rural France to improve quality of life and attract young people. “One challenge is how  France  Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit.  0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  2030 2029 2028 2027 2026 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013  Incremental decline scenario: France Baseline scenario: France Unleashing scenario: France  Rural GDP, real (2005 prices; US$ bn)  France  Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit.  2,000  2,200  2,400  2,600  2,800  3,000  3,200  2,000  2,200  2,400  2,600  2,800  3,000  3,200  2030 2029 2028 2027 2026 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013  Incremental decline scenario: France Baseline scenario: France Unleashing scenario: France  GDP, real (2005 prices; US$ bn)   19  © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2015  Unleashing rural economies  France  Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit.  0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  2030 2029 2028 2027 2026 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013  Incremental decline scenario: France Baseline scenario: France Unleashing scenario: France  Real GDP growth (%)  to improve the supply and the accessibility of services to residents and to businesses, especially in those areas which are the most neglected,” says Mr Houllier. “If there are no services, people will not stay for long.” These services include healthcare, education and transport, but also broadband Internet and mobile connectivity. “The key to rural development lies in providing the public goods and an attractive social and natural environment to ensure quality of life,” concludes Mr Mahé.  Forecasts under The Economist Intelligence Unit’s “unleashing” scenario indicate that, in the case of a hard landing in China, France’s GDP growth initially slows under the impact of the global economic downturn on exports, confi dence and fi nancing. The crisis forces the government to undertake structural reforms to boost growth prospects, including loosening the country’s strict labour laws so as to encourage investment and employment growth. Increased productivity raises growth rates in the agricultural sector, as well as in broader elements of the rural economy.  Under the unleashing scenario, the hard landing in China sees France’s recovery falter, but resume again in 2016 (see Chart 5). The rural economy fuels GDP growth to the extent that total GDP growth following the hard landing in the unleashing scenario outstrips baseline GDP growth by 2021 and continues making a signifi cant contribution to growth beyond. Real GDP growth is forecast to ease to 2% by 2030 under the unleashing scenario, which is nevertheless signifi cantly higher than the 1.3% expected under the baseline scenario.  Our model foresees growth in rural GDP to US$615.2bn by 2030 under the unleashing scenario—representing fully US$134.5bn of annual output on top of the US$480.7bn foreseen under our baseline scenario (see Table 5). Because structural reforms also boost job creation elsewhere, the share of the rural population does not rise dramatically compared with the baseline. However, the unleashing scenario sees a rural population slightly above the baseline expectation, as rural areas maintain their importance in a growing, more dynamic economy.

Nevertheless, while India’s 850m rural population amounts to 68.7% of the country’s 1.24bn total, rural inhabitants are continuing to move towards the cities.  Poor local governance is one factor hampering rural development, according to experts interviewed for this research. India’s constitution provides for powers in 29 areas—for example, local planning, education, and healthcare—to be devolved to local-government institutions, or panchayats. However, “The local panchayat institutions have not been able to function to their full potential,” observes Mr Rao. The Roadmap for the Panchayati Raj (2011–17)  1,  published by the government of India, highlights a lack of adequate devolution to many regional authorities, excessive bureaucracy, and a heavy dependence on government funding among the reasons that local government tends to be ineffective.  A further hurdle to development in rural India is the lack of an organised supply chain. “Where I work, in the eastern part of India, the organised sector penetration in dairy is just about 10%,” says Srikumar Misra, founder and CEO of Milk Mantra, an Indian dairy company. The remaining dairy production, he says, goes through informal networks, preventing farmers from benefi ting from transparency and market pricing. “Unless these producers are connected to the processors  India 5  or the markets through organised value chains, their growth becomes completely stunted and is absolutely unreliable as a sustainable economic model for them,” he says.  Moreover, to unlock potential growth in India’s rural economies, further investment is needed in food-processing and supply-chain infrastructure, according to experts. “A lot of agricultural produce does not reach consumers in time because there are transportation and storage bottlenecks,” points out Mr Rao, who estimates that up to 40% of perishable commodities and food grains are wasted. What is needed is “larger markets, storage facilities, processing facilities and also cold storage for perishable commodities like fruits, fi sh, and vegetables,” he says.  Another requirement to bolster rural economies is further investment in irrigation, including improved management of rainwater. According to Mr Rao, better management of water resources would enable many farmers to plant a second crop, where today almost 60% of the land cultivated in India is single-crop. “When we look at the poverty map of India and the single-crop map, wherever there is single crop, you can also see the poverty zones,” says Mr Rao. “A second crop will defi nitely improve living conditions.” Provisioning the infrastructure to enable this would unlock growth, reduce poverty and improve the quality of life in rural areas.  In the hard landing that triggers the scenario modelled by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the “unleashing” of rural growth, India sees considerable outfl ows of foreign capital, weakening the rupee and eroding the current-account surplus. Real incomes are reduced across the board, causing tensions among  1 http://www.  panchayat.gov.in/ documents/10198/370581/ Panchayati_Raj_Final_ pdf_02-5-11.pdf  When we look at the poverty map of India and the single-crop map, wherever there is single crop, you can also see the poverty zones,” says Mr Rao.

In response, India’s government implements further initiatives to ease rural poverty, including investment in rural infrastructure. In addition, laws against foreign investment in retail are repealed or reformed. Farmers receive a greater share of the fi nal sale price of agricultural commodities, pushing up profi tability and engaging market forces to reward productivity increases.  The growth path under the baseline scenario and the unleashing scenario appear largely similar over the forecast period (see Chart 6). One reason for this is that our baseline forecasts for India refl ect our expectation that reforms will open up growth and prosperity in the urban economy in the medium-to-long term.

Another reason for this is that the hard landing in China, the basis for our unleashing scenario, triggers a decline in India’s GDP growth in the fi rst part of our forecast period, but further reforms provide the conditions for the rural economy to regain lost ground. Such reforms could pave the way for a stronger rural economy beyond our forecast period than under the baseline scenario.  India has the potential to nearly double its annual rural GDP in the years to 2030 (see Table 6). Policy measures to promote rural development have the potential to drive rural GDP to US$1.48trn by 2030, fully US$710bn more than under our “business as usual” assumption  of US$768.7bn—and more than the entire GDP of the country today. If this comes to pass, the structure of India’s economy also shifts, with 39.8% of economic output stemming from rural areas, versus just 18.6% according to our “baseline” scenario.  Under our unleashing scenario, as China experiences a hard landing, the comparatively depressed state of manufacturing increases the appeal of rural employment, causing urbanisation to slow. According to our forecasts, rural population levels rise slightly, to 69.5% by 2030 from 68.7% in 2013. Conversely, in the baseline scenario, the rural population slides to just 51.4% of the total by 2030. While the shifts in growth are clear, the opportunities for more inclusive growth, which can be provided by a shift empowering rural residents, are less obvious.

In Nigeria, oil production has led to signifi cant environmental damage around the Niger Delta, affecting the ability of rural populations to maintain their livelihood there. A total of 85.8m people live in Nigeria’s rural areas, equivalent to 49.2% of the total 174.5m population. Expected population growth to around 272m in 2030  2 is likely to place  emphasis on the need for food security.  Some states in Nigeria have invested in developing urban infrastructure projects as part of their urbanisation policies, at times at the expense of investment in the rural economy. “What is tending to happen in some states is that resources are almost 100% committed to [high-profi le urban-development projects, in preference to less visible rural-development projects],” says Kolawole Adebayo, a lecturer at the Federal University of Agriculture in Abeokuta (FUNAAB). Nevertheless, urbanisation is creating new markets for farm produce. Luc Rigouzzo, managing partner at Amethis Finance in France, points out that the main markets for Nigerian farm produce are now urban, rather than export-led. As Nigeria’s urban population continues to expand, Mr Rigouzzo expects, “You will see a gradual shift, where Nigerian farmers will produce more and more food crops for the urban consumer.”  A barrier to better rural economic performance is local governance. Nigeria operates a three-tier government system, comprising the federal, state and local governments. “I would look for a more decentralised Nigeria, with local government being in charge of municipal  Nigeria 6  facilities,” says Mr Adebayo. He believes decentralisation would free up funds that are currently earmarked for rural areas, but do not reach them, because they are blocked at federal or state level, or are used for other purposes; under decentralisation, local governments would gain autonomy that he says will allow them to have a meaningful impact on rural economies.  A further obstacle to rural economic development in Nigeria is poor social infrastructure; not least of these concerns is the fact that further investment in education is needed. Levels of literacy and education in general remain low, points out Louw Burger, managing director at Thai Farm International, which processes cassava tubers in Osasa, 120km north-east of the capital, Lagos. “As a consequence, there is reluctance to build a factory in rural areas,” he says. “The processing of the agricultural goods tends to concentrate around bigger urban areas.” Rural economies not only miss out on jobs in agriculture, but, crucially, also in ancillary sectors.  More investment in healthcare facilities and other social services is also needed. “If social infrastructure is lagging behind—if you don’t have a minimum social infrastructure or schooling or medical care—it is not very attractive for young farmers to stay in a certain region,” says Hans Jöhr, corporate head of agriculture at Nestlé in Switzerland. The point is underscored by Mr Adebayo: “The facilities in rural areas are terrible,” he says. “The more skilled human resources don’t want to stay in rural areas because they feel like second-class citizens.”  2 Economist Intelligence  Unit forecast.

Private operators such as Thai Farm have to bear the cost of providing their own power and water: “We are not even connected to the national grid,” says Mr Burger. “We generate about a megawatt of power to provide for our own electricity needs”. Thai  Farm also relies on boreholes for water, which the fi rm purifi es itself.

Modelling this scenario, we included adjustments to factor in improved institutional quality and improved governance. We expect growth in capital investment, including in social infrastructure, which results in improved education outcomes, a better-educated workforce and improving economic growth.  According to our unleashing scenario, while a hard landing in China leads to a marked slowdown in Nigeria’s real GDP growth, to 3.2% in 2018, the subsequent rebound, which is driven in part by growth in the rural economy, sees real GDP growth outstrip growth under the baseline scenario by 2023 (see Chart 7). Real GDP growth in 2030 reaches 8.6% in the unleashing scenario, triggered by reforms following a hard landing in  China, signifi cantly higher than the 4.3% under the baseline scenario.  According to our estimates, Nigeria has the potential to expand its rural GDP to US$408.8bn by 2030, representing a signifi cant US$155.7bn of additional annual output from Nigeria’s rural economies over and above the baseline scenario (see Table 7). This represents fully 52.3% of Nigeria’s total US$781.1bn GDP at that time.  Under the unleashing scenario, we foresee limited migration from the cities for opportunities in agriculture in rural areas, given that unemployment has historically been highest in rural areas. We forecast the rural population’s increasing to 51% of the total by 2030, from 49.2% in 2013, while, under the baseline scenario, the fi gure falls to 47.2%.

Within this headline fi gure, reforms aimed at promoting rural development are signifi cant, because a strong rural economy, in itself, has the potential to add balance to, and, indeed, to bolster overall economic growth.  Crucially, a strong rural economy has the opportunity to benefi t from the multiplier effect across the agricultural sector and ancillary industries that operate around food production and related manufacturing activities. Moreover, a diversifi ed rural economy will see the growth of service sectors such as healthcare, education, leisure and tourism.  Investing in rural growth may also offer a means by which to lessen the economy’s exposure to exogenous events—such as a global economic slowdown—for example, in the case of economies that are heavily reliant on manufacturing exports.  Not least, solid rural economic performance is critical for individual regions and nations as a tool with which to reduce income disparities between the rural and urban populations, reducing poverty and bringing rural living standards into line with those in urban areas.  The fi ndings of the economic-modelling exercise and in-depth interview programme that form part of this research demonstrate that policymakers across the globe have a number of policy levers at their disposal with which to strengthen rural  development and unlock rural economic growth, with positive consequences for overall growth and development.  These policy levers may be applied to a number of different— but interlinked—areas, including reform of rural governance, legal reforms addressing land ownership and use, investment in operational infrastructure, such as roads or storage facilities, as well as investment in social infrastructure, such as education and healthcare facilities.  As Robin Bourgeois, senior foresight expert at the Global Forum on Agricultural Research, asserts, “One of the key drivers is the willingness to invest, from a policy point of view, in a more balanced, territorial development.”  This research also demonstrates that policymakers have the opportunity to take a holistic approach to government— embracing rural development as an integral part of national economic growth—to promote rural development as an integral part of wider economic and social wellbeing.  The steps necessary to unlock growth, as discussed in this report, provide an indication of the measures that are possible. The trigger employed in this modelling endeavour and the reforms highlighted as part of this research by no means represent the only path to unleashing rural economic growth. Rather, this report lays out some of the options and routes forward. A more dynamic trajectory for rural economies is possible, and effective reforms would meaningfully improve the lives of billions.   While every effort has been taken to verify the accuracy of this information, The Economist Intelligence Unit cannot accept any responsibility or liability for reliance by any person on this report or any of the information, opinions or conclusions set out in this report.

      "text": ["Economic Analysis - Living With Lower Oil Prices: Policy Response Is Key 08 Feb 2016 Global Economy  BMI View: Among the world's top 15 oil producers, the policy response to low oil prices is varying widely, with implications for macroeconomic stability, political risk and the Oil & Gas industry itself. Some countries such as Mexico are well-positioned to cope with a sustained period of subdued oil prices, while others such as Russia, Nigeria and Venezuela face a protracted period of political and economic turmoil.  The world's leading oil producers have weathered the initial shock of the oil price plummet that began in the second half of 2014, and now need to adjust to the reality of a protracted period of low oil prices. Although prices are set to recover in the second half of 2016 as a supply correction takes shape, the rebound will be gradual. We forecast that Brent crude will average USD40.0 per barrel (/bbl) in 2016, USD53.0/bbl in 2017 and USD62.0/bbl in 2018.  Policy responses are varying widely among the oil producers, with important implications for macroeconomic stability, political risk and various industries, not least Oil & Gas. In this article, we examine the policies of the world's top 15 oil-producing countries. Based on their policy response to date and relative dependence on oil, we have grouped the countries into three categories, according to how well we think they will cope with subdued oil prices over the coming years.  Navigating Sustained Low Oil Prices Top 15 Oil Producers - Real GDP Growth, %  f = BMI forecast. Source: National sources, BMI  Well-positioned to cope - Iran, Mexico and the US. These economies are set to perform relatively well in spite of the collapse of oil prices. Iranian growth will accelerate as investment comes in and oil exports are ramped up following the removal of sanctions. Mexico is similarly on an uptrend, thanks to a spate of structural reforms carried out over 2013-2014, and the manufacturing sector is benefiting from cheaper oil. The US is a net oil importer, hence lower fuel prices have a positive impact on balance.  Undergoing challenging but necessary adjustments - Norway, Qatar, Canada, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, China and Kuwait. These countries are certainly feeling the pinch of lower oil prices and for the most part, growth has slowed significantly over recent years. However, the respective governments are using various policy tools to adapt to lower oil prices, as outlined below. The coming years will undoubtedly be challenging, but the economies will avoid crisis.  Avoiding reform, storing up problems - Nigeria, Iraq, Russia, Brazil, Venezuela. These economies are in, or close to, economic and political crisis. The crises are not wholly due to lower oil prices, but depleted oil revenues have certainly been a contributing factor. The policy response has been inadequate and reforms are sluggish at best. These countries face a very turbulent period over the coming 12-24 months, likely characterised by extremely weak economic performance, heightened social instability and investor retrenchment.  Below, we outline some of the key policy tools that the governments are using, and the implications thereof.  Policy Response 1: Cut Government Spending With oil revenues dramatically reduced, one of the most obvious policy responses is to cut government spending in a bid to mitigate the damage to the budget balance and avoid a costly run-up in debt. The government of Mexico has been proactive in this respect. Historically, around 30% of fiscal revenues have come from the hydrocarbon sector, and the government has accordingly tightened its belt. The 2016 budget entails sharp spending cuts, and we forecast that the budget deficit will shrink to 3.1% of GDP from 3.5% in 2015.  This material is protected by international copyright laws, and use of this is subject to our Terms & Conditions.  © 2016 Business Monitor International Ltd   There has also been a tangible shift towards fiscal prudence in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states of late - especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The governments mostly relied on reserves to finance large fiscal deficits in 2015 but they are set to consolidate spending in 2016. Subsidy cuts are likely, as are delays and cancellations in the largest capital expenditure projects which are not politically imperative.  Budgets Devastated Top 15 Oil Producers - Budget Balance, % Of GDP  f = BMI forecast. Source: National sources, BMI  Russia has seen some spending cuts. Wages have been frozen for some public sector employees, the indexation of pensions has been made less generous, and expenditure cuts have been earmarked for health, education, science and infrastructure. However, we believe that the government has not gone far enough. Sharper, albeit painful, cuts would be needed in order to avoid a significant erosion of the Reserve Fund (one of the funds used for fiscal stabilisation) at a time when access to international capital markets is limited by Western sanctions.  Heightened social instability is a natural consequence of spending cuts. In this respect, we highlight Iraq and Russia. In Iraq, cuts to public investment will affect the pace of reconstruction in areas recaptured from Islamic State, and could therefore result in deepening sectarian tensions given that the destruction is almost entirely taking place in Sunni areas. In Russia, the government will likely continue to suppress public wage and pension growth, and as mentioned, cuts will be implemented in certain areas of social expenditure. As living standards decline, the government's lofty approval ratings are likely to buckle.  Policy Response 2: Raise Fiscal Revenues While cutting expenditure is an effective means for limiting damage to the budget, revenue generation is also an important measure. On this front, there have been some notable steps forward in the GCC with the mooted region-wide sales tax, which may be introduced within the next two-to-three years. The government of Saudi Arabia has been particularly proactive. The 2016 budget includes plans for new taxes and the launch of a privatisation programme. On this note, there has been talk of opening up the massive state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco to privatisation. Our Oil & Gas analysts believe that the government is most likely to sell off part of the downstream assets, given that Aramco has a history of privatising refineries, while safeguarding its prized upstream assets.  Despite measures to boost revenues and cut spending, fiscal deficits will remain the order of the day for the world's leading oil producers. The primary source of funding for these deficits is debt issuance, meaning that the majority of oil producers have incurred a large increase in their debt burdens since oil prices collapsed. Sovereign risk has risen accordingly, but none of the 15 countries - bar Venezuela (see more detail below) - are at imminent risk of debt distress.

This has acted as an automatic stabiliser of sorts. It has enhanced the local currency value of oil revenues, boosted the international competitiveness of the non-oil sector, and crimped demand for imports.  This has worked well in Canada. Although the economy has undoubtedly taken a knock from lower oil prices, a major rebalancing has occurred, and the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector has been restored thanks to the weakness of the Canadian dollar.  An Automatic Stabiliser Exchange Rate Appreciation (+) Or Depreciation (-) vs US Dollar, %  f = BMI forecast. Source: Bloomberg, BMI  As shown in the accompanying chart, all of the currencies in question have depreciated against the US dollar over the past couple of years, and some have significant losses still in store. For example, in Nigeria, the stability of the naira at current levels is unsustainable. The government is vigorously attempting to defend the peg to the US dollar, using up foreign exchange reserves in the process. We expect that at some stage over the next 12-24 months, the central bank will be forced to let the currency go. Likewise, we anticipate that the respective authorities will allow the Iraqi dinar, Kuwaiti dinar and Iranian rial to depreciate amid subdued oil prices. There has been speculation in the financial markets regarding a devaluation of the Saudi Arabian riyal, but the risks are overblown in our view. The government prizes stability and has over US600bn in reserves which it can use to maintain the status quo.  Policy Response 4: Attract Investment Into The Oil & Gas Sector A longer-term strategy employed by some of the world's leading oil producers is to enhance the attractiveness of the Oil & Gas sector in a bid to ensure that investment is sustained despite lower oil prices. Mexico is a case in point. Following a disappointing oil licensing round in July 2015, the finance ministry  This material is protected by international copyright laws, and use of this is subject to our Terms & Conditions.  © 2016 Business Monitor International Ltd   made contract terms more attractive and flexible, resulting in the success of the two subsequent licensing rounds. In Iran, the petroleum contracts being offered for post-sanctions developments are far more competitive than previous contracts. The Iraqi oil ministry is consequently at risk of losing investment to Iran, and is therefore exploring options to boost the attractiveness of its own contracts.  Important changes are afoot in China. The government is aiming to streamline the businesses of the country's largest state-owned enterprises. In the upstream, PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC will likely be made to surrender exploration permits in which they have failed to meet investment and work commitments. The permits will then be auctioned off to other investors, including private players.  KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE OIL & GAS SECTOR  Brazil Beginning in 2015, legislators ramped up discussions concerning amendments to oil & gas policies which would potentially liberalise the sector. However, these reforms will prove insufficient given the governing party's need to maintain support from is working class base amid an ongoing political and economic crisis.  Canada The new Trudeau administration plans to cut generous subsidies for oil sands producers, although the ongoing decline of the sector will make this politically sensitive. The administration's increased environmental focus will likely weigh further on upstream development, particularly following the introduction of a carbon tax and a cap on greenhouse gas emissions in 2017.  China Import restrictions on 'teapot' refineries have been eased since July 2015. PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC will probably be made to surrender exploration permits in which they have failed to meet investment and work commitments. These permits will then be auctioned off to other investors, including private players. In November 2015, PetroChina announced plans to sell its 50% stake in Trans Asia Gas Pipeline Company.  Iran The new Iran Petroleum Contracts offered for post-sanctions developments are far more competitive than the previous buy-back contracts. Iraq Given that Iranian oil contracts have become more attractive than Iraqi contracts, the oil ministry will likely explore potential options to maximise the benefit to the government. Changes will probably mirror the Iran Petroleum Contract, such as remuneration linked to oil prices and technical complexity. Kuwait Kuwait has been a slow mover in the face of greater competition to attract foreign investors in Middle East. It will be unable to sign sufficient technical service  contracts to achieve its 4mn barrels per day (b/d) production target by 2020.  Mexico Following a disappointing first oil licensing round in July 2015, the finance ministry made contract terms more attractive, resulting in the success of the two subsequent licensing rounds. We expect further amendments to future contracts will bolster the appeal of forthcoming rounds amid weaker benchmark prices, unlocking the acreage's long-term prospectivity.  Nigeria The long-delayed Petroleum Industry Bill may be split, with the more politically sensitive parts separated from the industry-specific fiscal and regulatory reforms. Such a move would ease its passage through parliament, potentially resulting in the bill being passed in 2016. Norway In the near term, we do not see any changes being made to the fiscal and regulatory structure for oil & gas companies. The giant Johan Sverdrup field will provide a cushion for the oil industry adding over 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/day) of production from late-2019, reducing the government's  need to intervene in the sector.  Qatar Qatar has begun offering LNG price concessions. The clearest example is Rasgas' renegotiations with Petronet, which set a new precedent in Qatar's negotiations with its Asian buyers. This reflects structural changes in the global LNG market that will fundamentally reconfigure pricing formula and contractual terms in Asian LNG contracts.  Russia Crude oil export duty has been frozen until August 2016, rather than reduced as was previously planned. This will likely slow drilling programmes. The mineral extraction tax for non-liquefied gas exporters (Gazprom) will increase in 2016.  Saudi Arabia  The Saudi government has indicated that it may sell a stake in state-owned Saudi Aramco (the only company operating in the country's upstream oil & gas sector). BMI believes that the government is most likely to sell off part of the downstream assets.  UAE Dubai is currently licensing stakes in its major ADCO onshore concession. Given the length of the contract duration (40 years) and the low cost base of the resource, it is highly unlikely that the emirate will offer any significant concessions.  US The main change to the US energy sector is market determined. Namely, the lower profit margins on crude production will eliminate the higher-cost producers in unconventional plays, squeezing them out of the market. A more dramatic pullback in production will lead to a contraction in 2016 crude production, following several years of unprecedented growth.  Venezuela The continued slide in crude prices will wreak havoc on Venezuela's already tenuous economic situation and undercut any efforts to support upstream development in 2016. Reduced profitability combined with continued resource mismanagement will make it difficult for the government to fund its expansive social development programmes, bringing an end to the 20-year old Petrocaribe oil alliance. The new opposition-led National Assembly will usher in a more critical view of the sector, however, any meaningful reforms will be challenging to enact in 2016 given its extensive agenda. Source: BMI Source: BMI  Policy Response 5: Pursue Economic Diversification A further long-term strategy to cushion the effect of reduced oil revenues is to pursue economic diversification. Iran is well-positioned, in this respect. Economic diversification occurred out of necessity under previous sanctions, and tax revenues account for a greater share of government receipts than hydrocarbon revenues. Mexico is also well-placed. The manufacturing sector is thriving, and a variety of sectors, such as telecommunications, have benefited from the raft of reforms that took place over 2013 and 2014.  Certain parts of the GCC are also set to reap a dividend from diversification. In Dubai, the real estate, shipping and construction sectors are performing well. Qatar's infrastructure and services sectors also look promising thanks to government-led investment.  Minimal Policy Response: At Risk Of Crisis For those countries where few of the above-mentioned policy responses are being used - and where oil revenues are heavily relied on - crisis risks are building. Nigeria, Iraq, Russia, Brazil and Venezuela all face a period of severe economic and political turmoil. Moreover, the problems do not just stem from lower oil prices. All five face additional issues, ranging from sanctions in Russia to the Petrobras scandal in Brazil.  The risks are most acute in Venezuela, which has been going through political and economic upheaval for many months already. On this note, some commentators are speculating that a debt default is imminent. We acknowledge that the probability of a credit event is nearing 50%, but we view the probability of default as significantly lower than that implied by the market. This is due to our forecast for higher oil prices over the latter half of this year and  This material is protected by international copyright laws, and use of this is subject to our Terms & Conditions.  © 2016 Business Monitor International Ltd   probability of default as significantly lower than that implied by the market. This is due to our forecast for higher oil prices over the latter half of this year and indications that there is some common ground on fiscal reform between the legislature (controlled by the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática) and the administration of President Nicolás Maduro. We are confident that the government will only opt for default as a last resort, given the political and economic costs of missing payments.

Source: National sources, BMI  Click here to explore data Click here to explore data  While Iraq and Brazil are deeply mired in crisis territory, there are some tentative positive signs emerging from Nigeria and Russia. The Nigerian authorities approached the World Bank and the African Development Bank for financial assistance in January 2016, and the Russian government is reportedly lining up seven state companies for privatisation. These moves are indicative of the severity of the crisis, because the respective governments would have been very reluctant to make these decisions given the loss of sovereignty. Nevertheless, they mark merely the first few steps on a long and painful path to recovery.
